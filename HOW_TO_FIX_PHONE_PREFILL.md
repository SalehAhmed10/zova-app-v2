# How to Fix Phone Pre-fill for Your Account

## 🎯 TL;DR
Your Stripe account was created **without** phone information. Stripe doesn't allow updating phone numbers after the first onboarding link is created. You need to **delete and recreate** your Stripe account to enable phone pre-fill.

## ⚠️ Why This Happened

### The Stripe Restriction
From Stripe's documentation:
> "After you create an account link on a Standard account, you won't be able to read or write Know Your Customer (KYC) information. **Prefill any KYC information before creating the first account link.**"

### Your Current State
```
✅ Database has your phone: +44 310226959
✅ Edge function has phone pre-fill code
❌ Your Stripe account: acct_1SHpKtCXEzM5o0X3 (created without phone)
❌ Cannot update phone after first onboarding link
```

## 🔧 Solution: Delete and Recreate Your Stripe Account

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Option 1: Using the App (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Open Payment Setup Screen**
   - Go to Settings → Payment Setup

   - Confirm deletion
   - Your account `acct_1SHpKtCXEzM5o0X3` will be deleted

3. **Create New Account**
   - Tap "Connect with Stripe" again
   - System will detect you have phone: +44 310226959
   - New account will be created WITH phone pre-filled

4. **Complete Onboarding**
   - Verify your phone shows as +44 310226959

## 🛡️ Safety Considerations

### What Happens to Your Data?

#### Safe to Delete ✅
- Your Stripe account is in **test mode**
- No real money involved
- No customer data lost
- Database profile unchanged (phone stays: +44 310226959)

#### What Gets Deleted ❌
- Incomplete onboarding progress
- Must re-accept Stripe terms
- New account ID (old: acct_1SHpKtCXEzM5o0X3)

#### What Stays Intact ✅
- Your ZOVA profile
- Your phone number: +44 310226959
- Your email: artinsane00@gmail.com
- Your business name
- Your pending payouts: $402.80 (will be accessible after new onboarding)

## 🚀 Expected Results

### After Recreation
1. ✅ Phone will appear as **+44 310226959** in Stripe form
2. ✅ One less field to manually type
3. ✅ Faster onboarding experience
4. ✅ `company.phone` removed from requirements
5. ✅ Closer to accessing $402.80 pending payouts

### New Account ID
- Old: `acct_1SHpKtCXEzM5o0X3`
- New: `acct_XXXXXXXXXX` (generated by Stripe)
- Database will update automatically

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Phone Still Doesn't Appear

1. **Check Database**
```sql
SELECT phone_number, country_code 
FROM profiles 
WHERE email = 'artinsane00@gmail.com';
```
Expected: `phone_number: 310226959, country_code: +44`

2. **Check Edge Function Version**
Must be v104 or higher (has phone pre-fill code)

3. **Check Stripe Requirements**
After account creation, `company.phone` should NOT be in `currently_due`

### Common Errors

#### Error: "Account has pending payouts"
**Solution**: Payouts in test mode are virtual. Safe to delete.

#### Error: "Phone number invalid"
**Solution**: Verify phone format in database (+44310226959)

#### Error: "Account already exists"
**Solution**: Old account not deleted. Try delete function again.

## 🎯 Test Your Fix

### Verification Steps

1. **Delete Old Account**
   - Navigate to Payment Setup
   - Confirm deletion
   - Check database: `stripe_account_id` should be NULL

2. **Create New Account**
   - Tap "Connect with Stripe"
   - System creates account with phone
   - You receive onboarding URL

3. **Open Onboarding Form**
   - **LOOK FOR**: Phone field should show **+44 310226959**
   - **VERIFY**: `company.phone` not in requirements
   - **TEST**: Try proceeding to next field without typing phone

4. **Complete Onboarding**
   - Fill remaining fields
   - Submit form
   - Verify charges_enabled: true

## 📝 For Future Reference

### To Avoid This Issue
1. ✅ **Always** set phone in profile before creating Stripe account
2. ✅ Edge function checks for phone before account creation
3. ✅ If no phone, return error instead of creating account
4. ✅ Guide users to add phone first, then create Stripe account

### Code That Fixed It
```typescript
// Edge function: create-stripe-account v104
const account = await stripe.accounts.create({
  type: 'express',
  country: 'GB',
  company: {
    name: businessName,
    phone: phoneNumber || undefined  // ✅ Set at creation, not update
  }
})
```

## 🎓 What We Learned

### Key Insight
> Stripe's KYC fields (phone, DOB, SSN, etc.) are **immutable after first onboarding link**. Always set them during account creation, not via update.

### Why Update Didn't Work
```typescript
// ❌ THIS DOESN'T WORK (what we tried)
await stripe.accounts.update(existingAccountId, {
  company: { phone: '+44310226959' }
})
// Stripe silently ignores KYC updates

// ✅ THIS WORKS (what we should have done)
await stripe.accounts.create({
  company: { phone: '+44310226959' }
})
// Stripe accepts KYC at creation time
```

### If Issue Persists

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Phone appears in Stripe form
- ✅ `company.phone` not in `currently_due`
- ✅ Can proceed without typing phone
- ✅ Onboarding completes successfully
- ✅ $402.80 pending payouts accessible
