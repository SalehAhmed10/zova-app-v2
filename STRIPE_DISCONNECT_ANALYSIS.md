# Stripe Account Disconnect Analysis - artinsane00@gmail.com

## What Happened When You Clicked "Disconnect Account"

### Provider Account: Art Provider
- **Email**: artinsane00@gmail.com
- **Profile ID**: c7fa7484-9609-49d1-af95-6508a739f4a2
- **Business**: AI Provider
- **Stripe Account ID**: acct_1SHkk1EP7J9SnsWa (STILL IN DATABASE)

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL FINDINGS

### 1. Stripe Account Status - PARTIALLY DISCONNECTED
```typescript
Current Database State:
- stripe_account_id: acct_1SHkk1EP7J9SnsWa ✅ (Still there)
- stripe_charges_enabled: false ❌ (Disabled)
- stripe_details_submitted: false ❌ (Not submitted)
- stripe_account_status: "pending" ⚠️ (Not deleted)
```

**Analysis**: The disconnect function did NOT fully delete the Stripe account. It only:
- ✅ Called Stripe API to delete the account
- ❌ Left the stripe_account_id in the database
- ❌ Set charges_enabled = false
- ❌ Set details_submitted = false

### 2. Active Subscription - STILL ACTIVE
```typescript
Subscription Details:
- ID: sub_1SFE6LENAHMeamEYq24yX2za
- Status: ACTIVE ✅
- Plan: Provider Premium (£5.99/month)
- Customer ID: cus_TBbIQQ90ksfArT
- Current Period: Oct 6 → Jan 4, 2026
- Metadata: supabase_user_id matches provider ✅
```

**⚠️ PROBLEM**: You're still being charged £5.99/month even though Stripe payments are disconnected!

### 3. Booking History - 11 BOOKINGS AFFECTED
```sql
Total Bookings: 11
├── Completed: 6 bookings (£572.00 earned)
│   ├── With Payment Intent: 3 bookings ✅
│   └── Without Payment Intent: 3 bookings ⚠️
├── Cancelled: 4 bookings (refunded)
└── Declined: 1 booking (refunded)
```

**Payment Intents Status**:
- ✅ Recent bookings have `payment_intent_id` (connected to Stripe)
- ⚠️ Older bookings have NULL `payment_intent_id` (pre-Stripe setup)

**ANALYSIS**: Your past earnings are safe, but now you **cannot receive new payments** because:
- stripe_charges_enabled = false ❌
- Customer payments will fail if they try to book

---

## 🔍 What the Disconnect Function Does

### Edge Function: `delete-stripe-account`
**Location**: `supabase/functions/delete-stripe-account/index.ts`

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Gets user profile from database
2. ✅ Finds Stripe account ID (acct_1SHkk1EP7J9SnsWa)
3. ✅ Calls Stripe API: `stripe.accounts.del(stripeAccountId)`
4. ✅ Updates database profile:
   ```sql
   UPDATE profiles SET
     stripe_account_id = NULL,  -- ❌ But this didn't happen!
     stripe_charges_enabled = false,
     stripe_details_submitted = false,
     stripe_account_status = 'pending'
   ```

**⚠️ ISSUE**: The database update appears to have partially failed. The `stripe_account_id` is still present in the database even though charges are disabled.

## 💡 Current State Summary

### What's Working:
✅ Historical bookings are intact (11 bookings tracked)
✅ Past payments were successfully processed (£572 earned)
✅ Customer reviews and ratings preserved (3.0 avg rating)
✅ Provider services still active (3 services)
✅ Account verification status: approved

### What's Broken:

❌ Still paying £5.99/month for Provider Premium (subscription active)
❌ Customers cannot complete bookings (payment will fail)

---

## 🎯 Recommended Actions

### Option A: Reconnect Stripe (Recommended for Active Providers)
1. Navigate to Payment Integration screen
2. Click "Connect Stripe Account" 
3. Complete Stripe onboarding flow
4. This will:
   - Create new Stripe account OR reactivate existing
   - Enable charges_enabled = true
   - Allow new bookings with payments
   - Justify the £5.99/month subscription

### Option B: Cancel Subscription (Recommended for Testing/Inactive)
Since you cannot receive payments but are still paying for Provider Premium:
```bash
Cancel Subscription: sub_1SFE6LENAHMeamEYq24yX2za
```
This will:
- Stop the £5.99/month charge
- Keep your profile and historical data
- Downgrade to free provider tier
- You can re-subscribe later when ready

### Option C: Full Account Reset (Nuclear Option)
1. Cancel subscription
2. Clear Stripe data from database:
   ```sql
   UPDATE profiles SET
     stripe_account_id = NULL,
     stripe_customer_id = NULL,
     stripe_charges_enabled = false,
     stripe_details_submitted = false,
     stripe_account_status = NULL
   WHERE id = 'c7fa7484-9609-49d1-af95-6508a739f4a2';
   ```
3. Start fresh with new Stripe setup

## 🐛 Bug Report: Disconnect Function Issue

**Issue**: Disconnect button did not fully remove Stripe account ID from database

**Evidence**:
```sql
Current State:
stripe_account_id: acct_1SHkk1EP7J9SnsWa  -- Should be NULL
stripe_charges_enabled: false              -- Correct
stripe_details_submitted: false            -- Correct
```

**Expected Behavior**: 
- stripe_account_id should be NULL after disconnect
- Account should be fully removed from Stripe and database

**Actual Behavior**:
- stripe_account_id still present
- Charges disabled but account ID remains
- Creates confusion about account status

**Recommendation**: Fix the edge function to ensure complete cleanup
