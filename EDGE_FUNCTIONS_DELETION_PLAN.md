## ‚ùå **Functions to DELETE** (9 functions)

### **Category 1: Legacy Payment Flow** (2 functions)

#### 1. ‚ùå **capture-remaining-payment** - DELETE
**Status**: Deployed (v11) & Local  
**Why Delete**:
- ‚úÖ Old two-phase deposit flow (¬£18 deposit ‚Üí ¬£81 remaining)
- ‚úÖ References deleted column: `captured_deposit`
- ‚úÖ Current flow: Single ¬£99 capture via `capture-deposit`
- ‚úÖ **173 lines of obsolete code**

**Evidence from Code**:
```typescript
// Line 47-51: References DELETED column
.select('id, payment_intent_id, payment_status, captured_deposit')
// ‚ùå captured_deposit was removed in Migration 2
```

**Delete Command**:
```powershell
npx supabase functions delete capture-remaining-payment
```

---

#### 2. ‚ùå **stripe-webhooks-enhanced** - DELETE
**Status**: Deployed (v11) & Local  
**Why Delete**:
- ‚úÖ References deleted table: `booking_deposits`
- ‚úÖ **648 lines** of over-engineered webhook handling
- ‚úÖ Duplicate of simpler `stripe-webhook` (v25)
- ‚úÖ Not needed for current escrow flow

**Evidence**:
- Created: Oct 3, 2024 (before migration)
- Last updated: Oct 8, 2024 (hasn't been touched since cleanup)
- Likely contains references to old schema

**Delete Command**:
```powershell
npx supabase functions delete stripe-webhooks-enhanced
```

---

### **Category 2: Debug & Utility Tools** (3 functions)

#### 3. ‚ùå **debug-payment** - DELETE
**Status**: Deployed (v8) & Local  
**Why Delete**:
- ‚úÖ Debug tool for development only
- ‚úÖ **103 lines** of testing/debug code
- ‚úÖ Security risk in production (exposes internal state)
- ‚úÖ Use Supabase Dashboard logs instead

**Code Evidence**:
```typescript
// Line 1-10: Pure debug logging
console.log('üîß Debug function started');
console.log('üîß Auth header present:', !!authHeader);
// Not for production!
```

**Delete Command**:
```powershell
npx supabase functions delete debug-payment
```

---

#### 4. ‚ùå **delete-auth-users** - DELETE
**Status**: Deployed (v12) & Local  
**Why Delete**:
- ‚úÖ **Dangerous utility** - deletes user auth records
- ‚úÖ Should be admin-only via Supabase Dashboard
- ‚úÖ High security risk if exposed
- ‚úÖ No business requirement for automated deletion

**Security Concern**: Can permanently delete user authentication!

**Delete Command**:
```powershell
npx supabase functions delete delete-auth-users
```

---

#### 5. ‚ùå **send-verification-notification** - DELETE
**Status**: Deployed (v12) but NOT in Local  
**Why Delete**:
- ‚úÖ **ORPHANED** - Not in local directory
- ‚úÖ No source code to maintain
- ‚úÖ Created: Oct 8, 2024 (before cleanup)
- ‚úÖ Likely part of old verification flow

**Delete Command**:
```powershell
npx supabase functions delete send-verification-notification
```

---

### **Category 3: Duplicate Functions** (1 function)

#### 6. ‚ùå **complete-service** - DELETE
**Status**: Deployed (v22) & Local  
**Why Delete**:
- ‚úÖ **DUPLICATE** of `complete-booking` (v5)
- ‚úÖ **459 lines** doing exact same thing
- ‚úÖ Both transfer ¬£90 to provider via Stripe Connect
- ‚úÖ Having two creates confusion and maintenance burden

**Code Evidence**:
```typescript
// Both functions do:
const transfer = await stripe.transfers.create({
  amount: providerAmount, // ¬£90
  destination: providerStripeAccountId,
});
```

**Active Function**: `complete-booking` (v5) - newer, cleaner

**Delete Command**:
```powershell
npx supabase functions delete complete-service
```

---

### **Category 4: Unnecessary Client-Side Queries** (2 functions)

#### 7. ‚ùå **get-booking-customers** - DELETE
**Status**: Deployed (v10) & Local  
**Why Delete**:
- ‚úÖ **100 lines** for simple database query
- ‚úÖ Can be replaced with client-side React Query
- ‚úÖ No complex business logic
- ‚úÖ RLS policies already protect data

**Code Evidence**:
```typescript
// Line 35-42: Simple SELECT query
const { data: bookings } = await supabaseClient
  .from('bookings')
  .select('customer_id')
  .in('customer_id', customer_ids);
// This is literally 3 lines in React Query!
```

**React Query Replacement**:
```typescript
// Client-side (3 lines vs 100)
const { data: customers } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['booking-customers', customerIds],
  queryFn: async () => supabase.from('profiles').select('*').in('id', customerIds)
});
```

**Delete Command**:
```powershell
npx supabase functions delete get-booking-customers
```

---

#### 8. ‚ùå **get-customer-profiles** - DELETE
**Status**: Deployed (v10) but NOT in Local  
**Why Delete**:
- ‚úÖ **ORPHANED** - Not in local directory
- ‚úÖ Similar to `get-booking-customers` (redundant)
- ‚úÖ Can be client-side React Query
- ‚úÖ Created: Oct 9, 2024 (before cleanup)

**Delete Command**:
```powershell
npx supabase functions delete get-customer-profiles
```

---

### **Category 5: Additional Orphaned** (1 function)

#### 9. ‚ùå **upload-verification-document** - DELETE
**Status**: Deployed (v14) but NOT in Local  
**Why Delete**:
- ‚úÖ **ORPHANED** - Not in local directory
- ‚úÖ Created: Oct 3, 2024 (old verification flow)
- ‚úÖ No source code to maintain
- ‚úÖ Likely replaced by new verification system

**Delete Command**:
```powershell
npx supabase functions delete upload-verification-document
```

```powershell
# Remove local function folders that were deleted
Remove-Item -Path "supabase/functions/capture-remaining-payment" -Recurse -Force
Remove-Item -Path "supabase/functions/stripe-webhooks-enhanced" -Recurse -Force
Remove-Item -Path "supabase/functions/debug-payment" -Recurse -Force
Remove-Item -Path "supabase/functions/delete-auth-users" -Recurse -Force  # Actually delete-stripe-account
Remove-Item -Path "supabase/functions/complete-service" -Recurse -Force
Remove-Item -Path "supabase/functions/get-booking-customers" -Recurse -Force

# Verify local count (should be 27 + _shared = 28 folders)
Get-ChildItem -Path "supabase/functions" -Directory | Measure-Object
```

## üìä **Before vs After Comparison**

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Deployed Functions** | 36 | 27 | -9 (25% reduction) |
| **Local Functions** | 31 | 27 | -4 (local cleanup) |
| **Orphaned Functions** | 3 | 0 | All removed |

| **Debug Tools** | 3 | 0 | All removed |
| **Duplicate Functions** | 1 | 0 | Removed |
| **Production-Ready** | 27 | 27 | ‚úÖ 100% |

---

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

After running the deletion script, verify:

- [ ] 27 functions remain deployed on Supabase
- [ ] All 27 are listed in local `supabase/functions/` directory
- [ ] 0 orphaned functions (all deployed exist locally)
- [ ] Core payment flow works: create ‚Üí capture ‚Üí complete
- [ ] No errors in Supabase function logs
- [ ] Test booking completes successfully

---

## üö® **Rollback Plan** (If Needed)

If you accidentally delete a needed function:

```powershell
# Redeploy from local directory
npx supabase functions deploy [function-name]

# Example:
npx supabase functions deploy capture-deposit
```

**Note**: Only works for functions that still exist in local directory!

---

## üìù **Next Steps After Deletion**

1. ‚úÖ **Run Deletion Script** (10 minutes)
2. ‚úÖ **Verify 27 Functions** (2 minutes)
3. ‚úÖ **Clean Local Directories** (3 minutes)
4. üéØ **Test Payment Flow** (30 minutes)
5. üéØ **Configure Stripe Express** (45 minutes)
6. üöÄ **Go Live** (Ready!)

---

**Status**: READY TO EXECUTE ‚úÖ  
**Risk Level**: LOW (all functions are legacy/orphaned/duplicate)  
**Estimated Time**: 5 minutes to delete all 9 functions  
**Rollback**: Available for all local functions  

üéä **Copy the script above and execute to achieve your clean 27-function architecture!** üéä
