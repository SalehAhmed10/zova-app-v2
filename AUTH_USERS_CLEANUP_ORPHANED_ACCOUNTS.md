# üßπ Auth Users Cleanup - Orphaned Accounts Removal

**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Issue**: Deleted profiles from database but forgot to delete corresponding auth.users  
**Impact**: 13 orphaned auth accounts exist without profiles  
**Action**: Delete orphaned auth users, keep 3 admins

---

## üìä Current State Analysis

### **Total Auth Users**: 16
- **Orphaned (no profile)**: 13 ‚ùå (need deletion)
- **Admins (with profile)**: 3 ‚úÖ (keep these)

### **Orphaned Auth Users to Delete**:

### **Admin Accounts to KEEP** ‚úÖ:
```
1. dev.salehahmed@gmail.com (super-admin) - Dev Saleh Ahmed
2. admin@zova.com (admin) - Admin Zova
3. gyles@admin.com (admin) - Gyles Admin
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why This Happened

### **Your Previous Cleanup** (Ultimate Clean Slate Migration):
```sql
-- You deleted profiles from public.profiles
DELETE FROM profiles WHERE role NOT IN ('admin', 'super-admin');
-- Result: 12 non-admin profiles deleted ‚úÖ
```

### **What Was Missed**:
```sql
-- Auth users in auth.users schema were NOT deleted ‚ùå
-- Supabase auth.users is separate from public.profiles
-- Result: 13 orphaned auth accounts still exist
```

**Impact**:
- ‚ùå Orphaned auth users can still log in (but get errors because no profile)
- ‚ùå Clutters auth dashboard
- ‚ùå Potential security issue (zombie accounts)
- ‚ùå Not a true "clean slate"

---

## üîß Solution: Delete Orphaned Auth Users

### **Method 1: Via Supabase Dashboard** (Recommended - Manual but Safe)

#### **Step 1**: Navigate to Auth Users
```
URL: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/wezgwqqdlwybadtvripr/auth/users
```

#### **Step 2**: Identify Orphaned Users
Look for users **WITHOUT** profile data (no role, no name)

#### **Step 3**: Delete Each Orphaned User
1. Click on user email
2. Click "Delete User" button
3. Confirm deletion
4. Repeat for all 13 orphaned users

**Time**: ~5 minutes (13 users √ó 20 seconds each)

---

### **Method 2: Via SQL** (Faster but Requires Caution)

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: This deletes auth users permanently. Cannot be undone!

#### **Step 1: Verify Query (Safe - Read Only)**
```sql
-- Preview which auth users will be deleted
SELECT 
  au.id,
  au.email,
  au.created_at,
  CASE 
    WHEN p.id IS NULL THEN 'WILL BE DELETED'
    WHEN p.role IN ('admin', 'super-admin') THEN 'KEEP (ADMIN)'
    ELSE 'KEEP (HAS PROFILE)'
  END as action
FROM auth.users au
LEFT JOIN public.profiles p ON au.id = p.id
ORDER BY 
  CASE 
    WHEN p.id IS NULL THEN 1
    ELSE 2
  END,
  au.created_at DESC;
```

**Expected Result**: Should show 13 users marked "WILL BE DELETED"

---

#### **Step 2: Delete Orphaned Auth Users (DESTRUCTIVE)**

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Run this ONLY if Step 1 results look correct!

```sql
-- Delete auth users that don't have matching profiles
DELETE FROM auth.users
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT au.id
  FROM auth.users au
  LEFT JOIN public.profiles p ON au.id = p.id
  WHERE p.id IS NULL
);

-- Verify deletion count
-- Expected: 13 rows deleted
```

---

#### **Step 3: Verify Final State**
```sql
-- Should show only 3 admin users remaining
SELECT 
  au.id,
  au.email,
  p.role,
  p.first_name,
  p.last_name
FROM auth.users au
LEFT JOIN public.profiles p ON au.id = p.id
ORDER BY au.created_at ASC;
```

**Expected Result**:
```
Total auth users: 3
1. dev.salehahmed@gmail.com - super-admin - Dev Saleh Ahmed
2. admin@zova.com - admin - Admin Zova
3. gyles@admin.com - admin - Gyles Admin
```

---

### **Method 3: Via Supabase Management API** (Programmatic)

If you have Supabase Management API access:

```bash
# Get your service role key first
SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your_supabase_service_role_key"
PROJECT_REF="wezgwqqdlwybadtvripr"

# Delete each orphaned user by ID
curl -X DELETE \
  "https://${PROJECT_REF}.supabase.co/auth/v1/admin/users/028d75ea-5725-4267-81dc-f6186bbc54cb" \
  -H "apikey: ${SERVICE_ROLE_KEY}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${SERVICE_ROLE_KEY}"

# Repeat for all 13 orphaned user IDs
```

---

## üéØ Recommended Approach

### **My Recommendation**: Use **Method 1 (Dashboard)**

**Why**:
- ‚úÖ Visual confirmation (see exactly what you're deleting)
- ‚úÖ Safe (delete one at a time)
- ‚úÖ No SQL errors possible
- ‚úÖ Built-in confirmation dialogs
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly slower (5 minutes vs 30 seconds)

**When to use Method 2 (SQL)**:
- ‚úÖ You're comfortable with SQL
- ‚úÖ You've verified the preview query results
- ‚úÖ You want to delete all 13 at once
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk: If query is wrong, could delete admins (BACKUP FIRST!)

---

## üìã Step-by-Step: Dashboard Method (Safest)

### **Step 1: Open Auth Users**
```
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/wezgwqqdlwybadtvripr/auth/users
```

### **Step 2: Filter or Search**
- Use search box to find orphaned users
- Or scroll through list (only 16 users)

### **Step 3: Identify Admin Accounts to KEEP**
**DO NOT DELETE THESE**:
- ‚úÖ dev.salehahmed@gmail.com (super-admin)
- ‚úÖ admin@zova.com (admin)
- ‚úÖ gyles@admin.com (admin)

### **Step 4: Delete Orphaned Users One by One**

1. Click on: **pimemog974@gamegta.com**
   - Click "Delete User"
   - Confirm

2. Click on: **wawayow281@ampdial.com**

  1. dev.salehahmed@gmail.com
  2. admin@zova.com
  3. gyles@admin.com

## ‚úÖ Verification After Cleanup

### **Check 1: Auth Users Count**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_auth_users
FROM auth.users;
-- Expected: 3
```

### **Check 2: All Auth Users Have Profiles**
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as users_without_profiles
FROM auth.users au
LEFT JOIN public.profiles p ON au.id = p.id
WHERE p.id IS NULL;
-- Expected: 0 (no orphaned users)
```

### **Check 3: Admin Accounts Intact**
```sql
SELECT 
  au.email,
  p.role,
  p.first_name || ' ' || p.last_name as full_name
FROM auth.users au
INNER JOIN public.profiles p ON au.id = p.id
WHERE p.role IN ('admin', 'super-admin')
ORDER BY p.role DESC;
-- Expected: 3 rows (1 super-admin, 2 admins)
```

---

## üìä Before vs After

### **Before Cleanup**:
```
Auth Users:        16 total
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Admins:        3 (with profiles) ‚úÖ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Orphaned:      13 (no profiles) ‚ùå

Database:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Profiles:      3 (admins only) ‚úÖ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Auth Users:    16 (13 orphaned) ‚ùå

Status:            ‚ùå NOT CLEAN
```

### **After Cleanup**:
```
Auth Users:        3 total
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Admins:        3 (with profiles) ‚úÖ

Database:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Profiles:      3 (admins only) ‚úÖ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Auth Users:    3 (all have profiles) ‚úÖ

Status:            ‚úÖ COMPLETELY CLEAN!
```

## üö® Important Notes

### **About artinsane00@gmail.com**:
This appears to be your test provider account. It's orphaned (no profile), so it will be deleted. If you need this account:
- **Option 1**: Delete it now, create fresh test account later
- **Option 2**: Keep it (but it's orphaned and won't work anyway)

**Recommendation**: Delete it. You'll create proper test accounts during Phase 2 testing.

---

### **Why Auth Users Weren't Auto-Deleted**:

Supabase **does NOT** cascade delete auth users when you delete profiles because:
1. Auth (`auth.users`) and Profiles (`public.profiles`) are separate schemas
2. No foreign key constraint from auth ‚Üí profiles
3. Designed to prevent accidental auth deletion
4. Manual cleanup required (what we're doing now)

**This is intentional Supabase behavior for safety!**

---

## üîÑ Future Prevention

### **When Deleting Profiles in Future**:

Always delete in this order:
```sql
-- Step 1: Identify user IDs to delete
WITH users_to_delete AS (
  SELECT id FROM profiles WHERE role = 'customer' AND email LIKE '%test%'
)

-- Step 2: Delete from auth.users FIRST (if you have permission)
DELETE FROM auth.users
WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM users_to_delete);

-- Step 3: Then delete from profiles
DELETE FROM profiles
WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM users_to_delete);
```

**Or** (if no auth.users permission):
1. Delete profiles via SQL
2. Manually delete auth users via Dashboard
3. Much safer!

## üéØ Your Action Plan

### **Immediate (Next 5 Minutes)**:
1. Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/wezgwqqdlwybadtvripr/auth/users
2. Delete 13 orphaned users (one by one via Dashboard)
3. Verify: Only 3 admin users remain

### **Then Continue Phase 2**:
- ‚úÖ Database: Clean (3 profiles, 0 test data)
- ‚úÖ Auth: Clean (3 users, 0 orphans) ‚Üê After you delete
- ‚úÖ Functions: Clean (27 production, 0 legacy)
- ‚è≥ Stripe: Configure branding (next step)

**Total cleanup time**: 5 minutes  
**Then back to**: Stripe branding ‚Üí Production launch
