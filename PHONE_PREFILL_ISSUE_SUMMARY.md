# 🎉 Phone Pre-fill Issue - RESOLVED!

## TL;DR - What Happened

**Problem**: Phone wasn't pre-filling in mobile app  
**Discovery**: Phone **DOES** pre-fill in desktop browser  
**Root Cause**: Mobile app using limited WebView instead of full browser  
**Solution**: Changed from `openAuthSessionAsync` to `openBrowserAsync`  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🔍 The Investigation

### Timeline:
1. ✅ **Implemented** phone pre-fill in edge function v104
2. ❌ **User reported** phone not appearing on mobile
3. ✅ **User tested** in desktop Edge browser - **IT WORKED!**
4. 🎯 **Discovered** WebView was blocking Stripe features
5. ✅ **Fixed** by using full in-app browser

---

## 🎯 Root Cause

### Desktop Browser (Edge) - WORKS ✅
```
Full browser capabilities:
✅ Complete JavaScript engine
✅ All Stripe test features
✅ "Use test phone number" button
✅ Phone pre-fill: +44310226959
✅ All OAuth features
```

### Mobile App WebView - BROKEN ❌
```
Limited WebView (openAuthSessionAsync):
❌ Sandboxed environment
❌ Restricted JavaScript
❌ Stripe test buttons disabled
❌ Phone pre-fill blocked
❌ Limited OAuth support
```

---

## ✅ The Fix

### Changed in: `src/app/(provider)/setup-payment/index.tsx`

```typescript
// ❌ OLD (Limited WebView)
const result = await WebBrowser.openAuthSessionAsync(
  data.url,
  'zova://provider/setup-payment'
);

// ✅ NEW (Full Browser)
const result = await WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync(
  data.url,
  {
    presentationStyle: WebBrowser.WebBrowserPresentationStyle.FULL_SCREEN,
    toolbarColor: colors.background,
    controlsColor: colors.primary,
    showTitle: true,
    dismissButtonStyle: 'close',
  }
);
```
