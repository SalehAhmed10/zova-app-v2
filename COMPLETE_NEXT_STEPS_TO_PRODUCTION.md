### **Step 2: Upload Platform Branding** (10 minutes)

**Action**: Upload ZOVA logo and set brand colors

2. **Express Dashboard**: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/connect/express-dashboard/branding

**What to Upload**:
```

Icon/Logo:            512x512px PNG (your ZOVA logo)

Statement descriptor: ZOVA (appears on bank statements)
```

**Where It Appears**:
- ✅ Stripe Connect onboarding flow
- ✅ Express Dashboard header
- ✅ Emails to providers
- ✅ Payment receipts

**Verification**: Click "Preview" to see how it looks

---

### **Step 3: Configure Express Dashboard Features** (10 minutes)

**Action**: Enable features providers need in their dashboard

**URL**: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/connect/express-dashboard/features

**Recommended Configuration**:
```
☑️ Payouts          - YES (providers need to see £90 payments)
☑️ Balance          - YES (show pending balance)
☑️ Transactions     - YES (show booking history)
☐  Customer list    - NO  (you handle customers in app)
☑️ Disputes         - YES (providers can respond)
☑️ Tax forms        - YES (UK/US tax compliance)
```

**Click**: "Save" after configuring

---

### **Step 4: Configure Email Settings** (10 minutes)

**Action**: Set up email configuration for provider communications

**URL**: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/connect/emails

**Required Settings**:
```
Platform website:    https://zova.app
Support email:       support@zova.app
Support phone:       +44 20 XXXX XXXX (your number)
```

**Optional - Custom Email Domain** (Recommended but takes 24-48 hours):
```
Email domain:        zova.app

*Note: Requires DNS configuration (TXT record verification)*

**Recommended for ZOVA**:
```
Payout schedule:     Daily automatic
Minimum payout:      £10.00
```

**Why Daily Automatic?**:
- Your `complete-booking` function transfers £90 immediately
- Money sits in provider's Stripe balance
- Daily automatic payouts = fastest payment to providers
- Good for provider satisfaction!
