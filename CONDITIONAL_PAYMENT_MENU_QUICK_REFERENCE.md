# Conditional Payment Menu - Quick Reference ✅

## 🎯 What We Built

Smart menu in provider profile that adapts based on payment setup status.

---

## 📊 Visual Comparison

### **BEFORE** (Static Menu - Always the Same)
```
Business Management
├── 📅 Calendar & Bookings
├── ⚙️  Services & Pricing
├── 💳 Payment Integration          ← Always showed this
├── 📊 Business Analytics
└── 💎 Premium Subscription
```

**Problem:** No distinction between "need to setup" vs "already setup"

---

### **AFTER** (Dynamic Menu - Adapts to State)

#### **Provider WITHOUT Payment Setup:**
```
Business Management
├── 📅 Calendar & Bookings
├── ⚙️  Services & Pricing
├── 💳 ⚡ Setup Payments [Required]  ← NEW: Urgent indicator
│       Required: Connect Stripe to start earning
├── 📊 Business Analytics
└── 💎 Premium Subscription
```

**Tapping this → Routes to:** `/(provider)/setup-payment` (Onboarding Wizard)

---

#### **Provider WITH Payment Setup:**
```
Business Management
├── 📅 Calendar & Bookings
├── ⚙️  Services & Pricing
├── 💳 Payment Integration          ← Standard settings option
│       Manage your Stripe account settings
├── 📊 Business Analytics
└── 💎 Premium Subscription
```

**Tapping this → Routes to:** `/(provider)/profile/payments` (Settings Screen)

---

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### 1. **Added Stripe Fields to ProfileData**
```typescript
// src/hooks/shared/useProfileData.ts
export interface ProfileData {
  // ... existing fields
  stripe_account_id?: string;           // ✅ NEW
  stripe_charges_enabled?: boolean;     // ✅ NEW
  stripe_details_submitted?: boolean;   // ✅ NEW
  stripe_account_status?: 'pending' | 'active' | 'inactive'; // ✅ NEW
}
```

### 2. **Conditional Menu Logic**
```typescript
// src/app/(provider)/profile.tsx
const businessManagementMenu = React.useMemo((): MenuItem[] => {
  const menu: MenuItem[] = [/* Calendar, Services */];

  if (!profileData?.stripe_account_id) {
    menu.push({
      title: '⚡ Setup Payments',
      badge: 'Required',
      onPress: () => router.push('/(provider)/setup-payment'),
    } as MenuItem);
  } else {
    menu.push({
      title: 'Payment Integration',
      onPress: () => router.push('/(provider)/profile/payments'),
    } as MenuItem);
  }

  menu.push(/* Analytics, Subscriptions */);
  return menu;
}, [profileData?.stripe_account_id]);
```
