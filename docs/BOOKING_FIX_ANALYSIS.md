# Booking Creation Fix Analysis

## Issue Identified
The booking creation was failing with the error:
```
"error":"Failed to create booking: invalid input syntax for type integer: \"93.5\""
```

## Root Cause
The database schema has a type mismatch for authorization/capture amount fields:

### Database Schema Analysis
```sql
-- These fields are INTEGERS (expecting whole numbers)
authorization_amount    INTEGER     -- Expected: 94 (pounds as integer)
captured_deposit       INTEGER     -- Expected: 17 (pounds as integer)  
remaining_to_capture   INTEGER     -- Expected: 77 (pounds as integer)

-- These fields are NUMERIC (accepting decimals)
base_amount           NUMERIC(10,2) -- £85.00
platform_fee          NUMERIC(10,2) -- £8.50
total_amount          NUMERIC(10,2) -- £93.50
```

### Data Being Sent
The frontend was sending:
- `authorization_amount: 93.5` (decimal)
- `captured_deposit: 17` (decimal)
- `remaining_to_capture: 76.5` (decimal)

But the database expected integers for these fields.

## Solution Implemented
Modified the Edge Function `supabase/functions/create-booking/index.ts` to convert decimal values to integers using `Math.round()`:

```typescript
// Before (causing error)
authorization_amount: authorization_amount || totalAmount,
captured_deposit: captured_deposit || (authorization_amount ? authorization_amount * 0.2 : totalAmount * 0.2),
remaining_to_capture: (authorization_amount || totalAmount) - (captured_deposit || (authorization_amount ? authorization_amount * 0.2 : totalAmount * 0.2)),

// After (fixed)
authorization_amount: Math.round(authorization_amount || totalAmount),
captured_deposit: Math.round(captured_deposit || (authorization_amount ? authorization_amount * 0.2 : totalAmount * 0.2)),
remaining_to_capture: Math.round((authorization_amount || totalAmount) - (captured_deposit || (authorization_amount ? authorization_amount * 0.2 : totalAmount * 0.2))),
```

## Verification
1. **Stripe PaymentIntent**: Still valid and working (`pi_3SFuYbENAHMeamEY16rId5qs`)
   - Status: `succeeded`
   - Amount: £93.50 (9350 pence)
   - Deposit Captured: £17.00 (1700 pence)
   - Ready for booking creation

2. **Database**: No booking record exists for this PaymentIntent, so the booking creation can be retried

3. **Edge Function**: Updated to version 40 with the integer conversion fix

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - The Edge Function now properly converts decimal amounts to integers before database insertion.

## Next Steps
The user can now retry the booking creation process and it should work successfully.
