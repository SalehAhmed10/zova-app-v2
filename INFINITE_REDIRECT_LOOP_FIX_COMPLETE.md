# Infinite Redirect Loop Fix - Complete

## Problem: Maximum Update Depth Exceeded

### Error Observed:
```
ERROR [Error: Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component 
repeatedly calls setState inside componentWillUpdate or componentDidUpdate. 
React limits the number of nested updates to prevent infinite loops.]
```

### Redirect Loop Pattern:
```
1. ProviderLayout (Guard 3): Incomplete profile → /(provider-verification) ✅
2. ProviderVerificationLayout (Guard 1): "Not authenticated" → /(auth) ❌ WRONG!
3. AuthLayout: Has session → /(provider) ✅
4. LOOP REPEATS → Maximum update depth exceeded 💥
```

### Logs Showing the Loop:
```
LOG [ProviderLayout] ⏸️ Incomplete profile, redirecting to /(provider-verification)
LOG [ProviderVerificationLayout] 🔐 Checking access... 
    {"hasSession": true, "isAuthenticated": true, ...}
LOG [ProviderVerificationLayout] ❌ Not authenticated, redirecting to /(auth)
LOG [AuthLayout] ✅ User authenticated with role, redirecting to dashboard
LOG [ProviderLayout] ⏸️ Incomplete profile, redirecting to /(provider-verification)
... (repeats indefinitely)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problematic Guard (Before Fix):
**File**: `src/app/(provider-verification)/_layout.tsx` Line 51

```tsx
// ❌ PROBLEMATIC: Checking 3 conditions with race condition
if (!session || !user || !isAuthenticated) {
  console.log('[ProviderVerificationLayout] ❌ Not authenticated, redirecting to /(auth)');
  return <Redirect href="/(auth)" />;
}
```

### Why This Failed:

1. **Session exists** (`session = true` from Zustand - instantly available)
2. **isAuthenticated = true** (computed from session: `const isAuthenticated = !!session`)
3. **BUT: `user` data not loaded yet** (from React Query - async fetch)

### The Race Condition:

```tsx
const { user, isAuthenticated } = useAuthOptimized(); // user from React Query
const session = useAuthStore((state) => state.session); // session from Zustand

// TIMELINE:
// T0: Component renders
// T1: session = available (Zustand - synchronous)
// T2: isAuthenticated = true (computed immediately)
// T3: user = undefined (React Query - still fetching) ← PROBLEM!
// T4: Guard checks: !user = true → Redirect to auth ❌
```

### The Logic Error:

Even though logs showed:
```
{"hasSession": true, "isAuthenticated": true}
```

The guard was checking `!user` which was **temporarily false during React Query fetch**, causing the redirect to auth layout, which then redirected back, creating an infinite loop.

## Solution Implemented

### Fixed Guard (After):
**File**: `src/app/(provider-verification)/_layout.tsx` Lines 48-59

```tsx
// ✅ FIXED: Only check session (immediately available)
// User data handled by loading state below
if (!session) {
  console.log('[ProviderVerificationLayout] ❌ No session, redirecting to /(auth)');
  return <Redirect href="/(auth)" />;
}

// ✅ Guard 2: Redirect non-providers to their dashboard
if (userRole !== 'provider') {
  console.log('[ProviderVerificationLayout] ❌ Not a provider, redirecting to /(customer)');
  return <Redirect href="/(customer)" />;
}
```

### Why This Works:

1. **Session check is sufficient** - If session exists in Zustand, user is authenticated
2. **User data loads after** - Handled by loading state at lines 117-124
3. **No race condition** - Session is synchronously available from Zustand
4. **Removed redundant checks** - `!user` and `!isAuthenticated` were unnecessary

### Loading State Already Exists:
**Lines 117-124** (Already present, no changes needed):

```tsx
// ✅ SAFETY: Don't render layout until user data is loaded
if (!isHydrated || !user?.id) {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView edges={['top']} className="flex-1 bg-background">
      <View className="flex-1 justify-center items-center">
        <Text className="text-muted-foreground">Loading verification...</Text>
      </View>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}
```

This loading state waits for `user?.id` to be available before rendering the verification flow, preventing any race conditions with route guards.

## Changes Summary

### File: `src/app/(provider-verification)/_layout.tsx`

**Lines Modified**: 48-57 (Guard 1)

**Before**:
```tsx
if (!session || !user || !isAuthenticated) {
  console.log('[ProviderVerificationLayout] ❌ Not authenticated, redirecting to /(auth)');
  return <Redirect href="/(auth)" />;
}
```

**After**:
```tsx
// Only check session - user data might still be loading from React Query
if (!session) {
  console.log('[ProviderVerificationLayout] ❌ No session, redirecting to /(auth)');
  return <Redirect href="/(auth)" />;
}
```

**Changes**:
- ❌ Removed `!user` check (causes race condition)
- ❌ Removed `!isAuthenticated` check (redundant with session)
- ✅ Keep only `!session` check (sufficient and synchronous)
- ✅ Added comment explaining why
- ✅ Updated log message for clarity

## Architecture Compliance

### ✅ React Query + Zustand Pattern
```tsx
// Global state: Zustand (synchronous, instant access)
const session = useAuthStore((state) => state.session);
const userRole = useAuthStore((state) => state.userRole);

// Server state: React Query (asynchronous, may still be loading)
const { user } = useAuthOptimized(); // Internal: useQuery for user data

// Guards use Zustand data (instant) for redirects
// Loading states handle React Query data (async)
```

### ✅ Proper Loading States
- Zustand checks first (instant redirects)
- React Query loading states second (show loading UI)
- No race conditions between state sources

### ✅ No useEffect for Guards
- Guards are pure conditional renders
- No side effects in guard logic
- Redirects happen during render phase

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Test 1: Provider with Incomplete Profile
```
1. Login as artinsane00@gmail.com
2. Should redirect to /(provider-verification) ✅
3. Should see "Loading verification..." briefly
4. Should see business-info screen ✅
5. NO infinite loop ✅
6. NO "Not authenticated" redirect ✅
```

### Test 2: Provider with Complete Profile
```
1. Login as complete provider
2. Should go directly to /(provider) dashboard ✅
3. NO redirect to verification ✅
```

### Test 3: Customer Login
```
1. Login as customer
2. Should redirect to /(customer) dashboard ✅
3. NO access to provider routes ✅
```

## Console Logs After Fix

### Expected Logs (No Loop):
```
LOG [ProviderLayout] 🔐 Checking access...
LOG [ProviderLayout] ⏸️ Incomplete profile, redirecting to /(provider-verification)
LOG [ProviderVerificationLayout] 🔐 Checking access... {"hasSession": true, "userRole": "provider"}
LOG [ProviderVerificationLayout] ✅ Access granted for provider verification
(Shows loading state while user data loads)
(Then renders business-info screen)
```

### Previous Logs (With Loop):
```
LOG [ProviderLayout] ⏸️ Incomplete profile, redirecting to /(provider-verification)
LOG [ProviderVerificationLayout] ❌ Not authenticated, redirecting to /(auth)
LOG [AuthLayout] ✅ User authenticated with role, redirecting to dashboard
LOG [ProviderLayout] ⏸️ Incomplete profile, redirecting to /(provider-verification)
... (repeats 50+ times)
ERROR Maximum update depth exceeded
```

## Testing Instructions

### Clear App & Restart:
```powershell
# Stop metro bundler (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Clear cache and restart
npm run android:clean
```

### Test Flow:
1. App should start without errors ✅
2. Should redirect to verification onboarding ✅
3. Should see business-info screen (not login) ✅
4. Complete business info form ✅
5. Continue through verification steps ✅
6. After completion, access dashboard ✅

## Related Files

### Modified:
- `src/app/(provider-verification)/_layout.tsx` (Guard 1 simplified)

### No Changes Needed:
- `src/app/(provider)/_layout.tsx` (Guard 3 working correctly)
- `src/app/(auth)/_layout.tsx` (Auth routing working correctly)
- `src/hooks/shared/useAuthPure.ts` (Hook working correctly)

## Success Criteria

✅ **No Infinite Loops** - Maximum 1 redirect per navigation
✅ **Proper Verification Flow** - Incomplete providers see onboarding
✅ **Proper Dashboard Access** - Complete providers see dashboard
✅ **No Race Conditions** - Session checks don't depend on async data
✅ **Clean Console Logs** - No repeated redirect messages
✅ **Smooth UX** - Loading states during data fetching

---

## Summary

The infinite redirect loop was caused by a **race condition** in the provider-verification layout's authentication guard. The guard was checking `!user` (from async React Query) in addition to `!session` (from sync Zustand), causing it to temporarily fail and redirect to auth, which then redirected back, creating an infinite loop.

**Fix**: Simplified the guard to only check `!session` (which is synchronously available), allowing the existing loading state to handle waiting for user data to load from React Query.

**Result**: Clean navigation flow with no loops, proper onboarding redirect for incomplete providers, and smooth user experience.
