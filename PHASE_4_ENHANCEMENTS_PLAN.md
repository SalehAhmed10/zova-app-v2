## 📊 Enhancement 1: Analytics Dashboard

### Objective
Create comprehensive analytics for platform owners, providers, and customers to track financial performance, booking trends, and service metrics.

### Features

#### 1.1 Financial Analytics
**Database Views to Create**:
```sql
-- Daily revenue summary
CREATE VIEW daily_revenue AS
SELECT 
  DATE(paid_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as total_bookings,
  SUM(amount) as total_revenue,
  AVG(amount) as avg_booking_value
FROM payments
WHERE status = 'paid'
GROUP BY DATE(paid_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Provider earnings
CREATE VIEW provider_earnings AS
SELECT 
  p.id as provider_id,
  p.business_name,
  COUNT(b.id) as total_bookings,
  SUM(b.base_amount) as gross_earnings,
  SUM(b.platform_fee) as platform_fees,
  SUM(b.base_amount) - SUM(b.platform_fee) as net_earnings
FROM providers p
JOIN bookings b ON b.provider_id = p.id
WHERE b.payment_status = 'paid'
GROUP BY p.id, p.business_name;

-- Service performance
CREATE VIEW service_performance AS
SELECT 
  s.id as service_id,
  s.title,
  s.provider_id,
  COUNT(b.id) as total_bookings,
  AVG(b.base_amount) as avg_price,
  SUM(b.total_amount) as total_revenue
FROM provider_services s
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON b.service_id = s.id
GROUP BY s.id, s.title, s.provider_id
ORDER BY total_bookings DESC;
```

#### 1.2 Booking Analytics
**Metrics to Track**:
- Booking conversion rate (searches → bookings)
- Popular services and providers
- Peak booking times and days
- Average booking value
- Cancellation rate
- Customer retention rate

**React Query Hooks to Create**:
```typescript
// src/hooks/analytics/useRevenueAnalytics.ts

  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['analytics', 'revenue', dateRange],
    queryFn: () => fetchRevenueData(dateRange),
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
  });
}

// src/hooks/analytics/useProviderPerformance.ts
export function useProviderPerformance(providerId: string) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['analytics', 'provider', providerId],
    queryFn: () => fetchProviderStats(providerId),
  });
}
```

#### 1.3 UI Components
**Screens to Create**:

## 🚀 Enhancement 5: Performance Optimization

### Objective
Further optimize application performance based on analytics data.

### Features

#### 5.1 Database Optimization

**Indexes to Add**:
```sql
-- Speed up booking queries
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_customer_date 
  ON bookings(customer_id, booking_date DESC);

CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_provider_date 
  ON bookings(provider_id, booking_date DESC);

-- Speed up payment lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_booking 
  ON payments(booking_id);

CREATE INDEX idx_payment_intents_stripe 
  ON payment_intents(stripe_payment_intent_id);

-- Speed up service searches
CREATE INDEX idx_services_provider_active 
  ON provider_services(provider_id, is_active);
```

**Query Optimization**:
- Analyze slow queries with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`
- Add materialized views for complex analytics
- Implement query result caching

#### 5.2 React Query Optimization

**Caching Strategy**:
```typescript
// Optimize staleTime based on data freshness needs
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes for most data
      cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes in memory
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
      retry: 1,
    },
  },
});
```

**Prefetching Strategy**:
- Prefetch provider details when viewing service
- Prefetch availability when selecting date
- Preload payment sheet assets

#### 5.3 Asset Optimization

**Image Optimization**:
- Implement next-gen image formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Add responsive image loading
- Implement lazy loading for images

**Bundle Optimization**:
- Analyze bundle size with Expo bundle analyzer
