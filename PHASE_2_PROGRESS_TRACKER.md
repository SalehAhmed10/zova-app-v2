```

**Optional but Recommended**:

Support email:         support@zova.app
Support phone:         +44 20 XXXX XXXX
Statement descriptor:  ZOVA (appears on bank statements)
```

**How to Upload Logo**:

3. Preview how it looks
4. Click "Save"

**Where This Appears**:

- ‚úÖ Email receipts to customers
- ‚úÖ Bank statements (if using statement descriptor)

---

#### **3.2 Express Dashboard Branding** (5 min)
Upload to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/connect/express-dashboard/branding

**Required Fields**:
```
Business name:         ZOVA
Icon:                  Upload same 512x512px PNG logo
Primary color:         #6366F1
```

**Preview Available**: Click "Preview" to see how providers will see it

- ‚úÖ Express emails to providers

**Action**:

2. Set colors
3. Preview
4. Save

---

### üìß **Step 4: Configure Email Settings** (~10 minutes)

**URL**: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/connect/emails

**Required Settings**:
```
Platform website:      https://zova.app
Support email:         support@zova.app
Support phone:         +44 20 XXXX XXXX (your number)
```

**Optional - Custom Email Domain** (Recommended for production):
```
Email domain:          zova.app
From address:          noreply@zova.app
```

**Note**: Custom domain requires DNS verification (24-48 hours delay). You can add this later before going live.

**What This Does**:
- Stripe emails to providers come "from ZOVA"
- Support links point to your website/email
- Professional appearance

**Action**:
1. Enter platform URL
2. Enter support email and phone
3. (Optional) Set custom domain (can do later)
4. Save

---

### üí≥ **Step 5: Configure Payout Settings** (~5 minutes)

**URL**: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/connect/payouts

**Recommended Configuration**:
```
Payout schedule:       Daily automatic
Minimum payout:        ¬£10.00
```

**Why Daily Automatic?**
- Your `complete-booking` function transfers ¬£90 immediately
- Money sits in provider's Stripe balance
- Daily payouts = fastest payment to providers (good for satisfaction!)
- Alternative: Weekly Monday (as in your code) - either works!

**Current Code Says**:
```typescript
// In create-stripe-account/index.ts (line 348)
settings: {
  payouts: {
    schedule: {
      interval: 'weekly',
      weekly_anchor: 'monday'
    }
  }
}
```

**Decision Time**:
- **Keep Weekly Monday**: Predictable, good cash flow planning
- **Change to Daily**: Faster provider payments, better satisfaction

**My Recommendation**: Start with **Daily automatic** for better provider experience

**Action**:
1. Select "Daily automatic"
2. Set minimum: ¬£10.00
3. Save

### üß™ **Step 6: Test Provider Onboarding** (~15 minutes)
