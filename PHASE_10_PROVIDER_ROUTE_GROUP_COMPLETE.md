# ✅ Provider Route Group Migration Complete

## 🎯 What We Did

Converted `src/app/provider/` to `src/app/(provider)/` route group with **role-based authentication guards** and **verification status handling**.

```

### **Before** ❌
```
src/app/
├── provider/                 ← Regular folder
│   ├── index.tsx            → /provider (any role could access!)
│   └── _layout.tsx          ← Used old useSession()
```

### **After** ✅
```
src/app/
├── (provider)/              ← Route group (protected)
│   ├── index.tsx           → /provider (provider role only!)
│   └── _layout.tsx         ← Uses Zustand, with guards
```

**URLs remain the same**: `/provider`, `/provider/bookings`, `/provider/earnings`, etc.

---

## 🔐 Multi-Layer Protection Added

### **Guard Logic in `(provider)/_layout.tsx`**

```typescript
export default function ProviderLayout() {
  const session = useAuthStore((state) => state.session);
  const userRole = useAuthStore((state) => state.userRole);
  const isHydrated = useProfileHydration();

  console.log('[ProviderLayout] 🔐 Checking access...', { 
    hasSession: !!session, 
    userRole,
    isHydrated 
  });

  // Wait for store hydration
  if (!isHydrated) {
    console.log('[ProviderLayout] ⏳ Waiting for hydration...');
    return <LoadingScreen />;
  }

  // ✅ Guard 1: Redirect unauthenticated users to login
  if (!session) {
    console.log('[ProviderLayout] ❌ Not authenticated, redirecting to /auth');
    return <Redirect href="/auth" />;
  }

  // ✅ Guard 2: Redirect non-providers to their dashboard
  if (userRole !== 'provider') {
    console.log('[ProviderLayout] ❌ Not a provider, redirecting to /customer');
    return <Redirect href="/customer" />;
  }

  console.log('[ProviderLayout] ✅ Access granted for provider');

  // ✅ Verification & Payment Setup Banners (non-blocking)
  return (
    <View className="flex-1 bg-background">
      <VerificationStatusBanner />  {/* Shows during pending verification */}
      <PaymentSetupBanner />         {/* Shows when payment not set up */}
      <Tabs>{/* Provider screens */}</Tabs>
    </View>
  );
}
```

### **Protection Matrix**

| User State | Accessing `/provider` | Result |
|------------|----------------------|--------|
| ❌ Not logged in | `/provider` | 🔄 → `/auth` (login) |
| ✅ Logged in (provider) | `/provider` | ✅ Shows provider dashboard |
| ✅ Logged in (customer) | `/provider` | 🔄 → `/customer` (their dashboard) |
| ✅ Provider (unverified) | `/provider` | ✅ Shows dashboard + Verification Banner |
| ✅ Provider (verified, no payment) | `/provider` | ✅ Shows dashboard + Payment Setup Banner |

---

## 🎯 Special Features: Verification Handling

### **Non-Blocking Verification Flow**

Unlike authentication, **verification is non-blocking**:
- ✅ Unverified providers CAN access provider dashboard
- ✅ They see a **VerificationStatusBanner** (informational)
- ✅ Banner shows: "Verification Pending" or "Under Review"
- ✅ Banner is dismissible (respawns after 24 hours)

**Why Non-Blocking?**
- Providers need to set up their profile
- They need to add services
- They need to configure payment methods
- All of this happens BEFORE verification is complete

### **Provider-Verification Route Group**

For the actual verification FLOW (document upload, selfie, etc.), there's a separate route group:
```
src/app/provider-verification/  ← Will be converted next
├── document-upload.tsx
├── selfie-capture.tsx
└── waiting-approval.tsx
```

This route group WILL be blocking:
- Only accessible by providers
- Only accessible if NOT yet verified
- Redirects verified providers back to dashboard

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

### **Scenario 1: Provider Accessing Own Dashboard**
```
User is logged in as provider (verified)
    ↓
Navigates to /provider
    ↓
(provider)/_layout.tsx checks:
  - session exists? ✅
  - userRole === 'provider'? ✅
  - isHydrated? ✅
    ↓
✅ Provider dashboard renders
✅ Tabs: Home, Calendar, Bookings, Earnings, Profile
✅ No banners (verified + payment set up)
```

### **Scenario 2: Unverified Provider**
```
User is logged in as provider (NOT verified)
    ↓
Navigates to /provider
    ↓
(provider)/_layout.tsx checks:
  - session exists? ✅
  - userRole === 'provider'? ✅
    ↓
✅ Provider dashboard renders
✅ VerificationStatusBanner shows at top
✅ Banner: "Verification Pending - Click to complete"
✅ Provider can still use dashboard features
```

### **Scenario 3: Customer Tries to Access Provider Dashboard**
```
User is logged in as customer
    ↓
Tries to navigate to /provider
    ↓
(provider)/_layout.tsx checks:
  - session exists? ✅
  - userRole === 'provider'? ❌ (it's 'customer')
    ↓
🔄 Redirects to /customer dashboard
    ↓
Customer CANNOT access provider screens
```

### **Scenario 4: Logged Out User**
```
User is NOT logged in
    ↓
Tries to navigate to /provider
    ↓
(provider)/_layout.tsx checks:
  - session exists? ❌
    ↓
🔄 Redirects to /auth (login screen)
    ↓
User must log in first
```

## 📊 Route Protection Summary

| Route Group | Protection | Redirect If | Verification |
|-------------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| `(public)` | None | N/A | N/A |
| `(auth)` | ✅ Authenticated users | → Dashboard | N/A |
| `(customer)` | ✅ Non-customers | → `/auth` or `/provider` | N/A |
| `(provider)` | ✅ **Non-providers & unauthenticated** | → `/auth` or `/customer` | **Non-blocking** (banner) |
| `provider-verification/` | ⏳ **Next step** | Not provider OR already verified | **Blocking** |

---

## 🔍 Technical Details

### **Why Non-Blocking Verification?**

**Traditional Approach** (Blocking):
```
Unverified Provider → Redirect to /provider-verification
    → User forced to complete verification
    → Cannot access dashboard until verified
    → BAD UX: User needs to set up profile first!
```

**Our Approach** (Non-Blocking):
```
Unverified Provider → Access to /provider dashboard ✅
    → Can set up profile
    → Can add services
    → Can configure payment
    → Sees VerificationStatusBanner (reminder)
    → When ready, clicks banner to complete verification
    → BETTER UX: User controls their journey
```

### **Verification Banner vs Verification Flow**

| Feature | Location | Purpose | Blocking? |
|---------|----------|---------|-----------|
| **VerificationStatusBanner** | `(provider)/_layout.tsx` | Informational reminder | ❌ No |
| **Verification Flow** | `provider-verification/` | Document upload process | ✅ Yes (when accessed) |

**VerificationStatusBanner**:
- Shows at top of provider dashboard
- Dismissible (respawns after 24 hours)
- Shows status: "Pending", "In Review", "Rejected"
- Links to verification flow

**Verification Flow** (Separate Route Group):
- Dedicated screens for uploading documents
- Selfie capture
- Status tracking
- Only accessible by providers
- Redirects verified providers away

### **Hydration Wait Pattern**

```typescript
const isHydrated = useProfileHydration();

if (!isHydrated) {
  return <LoadingScreen />;
}
```

**Why?**
- Provider profile data is stored in Zustand
- Zustand uses AsyncStorage persistence
- Must wait for data to load from storage (hydration)
- Without wait: Profile data would be null initially
- Would cause incorrect redirects or missing data

### **Migrated from useSession() to Zustand**

**Before**:
```typescript
import { useSession } from '@/app/ctx';
const { session, userRole } = useSession();
```

**After**:
```typescript
import { useAuthStore } from '@/stores/auth';
const session = useAuthStore((state) => state.session);
const userRole = useAuthStore((state) => state.userRole);
```
