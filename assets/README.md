# ZOVA App Assets

This directory should contain the following assets when you're ready to customize the app:

## Required Assets (for production):
- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024 recommended)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024 with transparent background)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon (32x32 or 64x64)

## Current Status:
The app.json is currently configured without custom assets to allow development without image files. Add the assets above and update app.json when ready for production builds.

## Optional Assets:
- `animations/` - Directory for Lottie animation JSON files
- Custom images for onboarding, illustrations, etc.

## Asset Guidelines:
- Use PNG format for icons and splash screens
- Ensure proper sizing for different platforms
- Test on both light and dark themes
- Optimize file sizes for mobile performance
