## 🔍 Escrow System Compatibility Check

### Analysis Results: ✅ NO CHANGES NEEDED

**Why this screen is already compatible:**

1. **No Payment Calculations**: This screen only displays:
   - Service title and description
   - Provider information
   - Service price (display only)
   - Rating and reviews
   - "Book This Service" button

2. **No Deposit References**: 
   - ✅ No "deposit" terminology
   - ✅ No "20%" calculations
   - ✅ No "remaining balance" mentions
   - ✅ No payment breakdown

3. **Simple Navigation**: 
   - Just passes service details to booking flow
   - `book-service.tsx` handles all payment logic
   - Already uses correct parameters

### What This Screen Does

```typescript
// Simply passes service data to booking screen
router.push({
  pathname: '/(customer)/booking/book-service',
  params: {
    serviceId: service.id,
    providerId: service.provider.id,
    providerName: service.provider.name,
    serviceTitle: service.title,
    servicePrice: service.price.toString()  // Just the service price
  }
});
```

**Result**: The booking flow (which has been updated) handles all escrow logic.
