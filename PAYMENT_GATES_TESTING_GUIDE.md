# Payment Gates Testing Guide

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist

### Prerequisites
- Provider account with `verification_status = 'approved'`
- Provider account with `stripe_charges_enabled = false` (payment not active)

---

## Test Scenario 1: Payment Setup Banner (30-40% Conversion)

### Setup
1. Log in as provider with approved verification, no payment
2. Navigate to provider dashboard

### Expected Behavior
âœ… Banner should appear at top of screen above tabs
âœ… Banner shows: "Setup Payments to Accept Bookings"
âœ… Banner has CreditCard icon
âœ… Banner has X dismiss button
âœ… Banner animates in with SlideInDown

### Interaction Tests
1. **Tap banner** â†’ Should navigate to `/provider/setup-payment`
2. **Tap X button** â†’ Banner should dismiss
3. **Close and reopen app** â†’ Banner should NOT reappear (7-day memory)
4. **Complete payment setup** â†’ Banner should auto-hide
5. **Clear AsyncStorage** â†’ Banner should reappear

### AsyncStorage Testing
```javascript
// To manually clear dismissal (test respawn)
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
await AsyncStorage.removeItem('payment-banner-dismissed');

// To check dismissal state
const dismissed = await AsyncStorage.getItem('payment-banner-dismissed');
console.log('Dismissed:', dismissed);
```

## Test Scenario 2: Booking Accept Gate (80-90% Conversion) ðŸ”¥

### Setup
1. Log in as provider with approved verification, no payment
2. Have a pending booking in system
3. Navigate to Bookings tab
4. Tap on pending booking

### Expected Behavior
âœ… Booking detail screen loads normally

## Test Scenario 6: Multi-Touchpoint Flow (Real User Journey)

### Day 1: Verification Approved
1. Provider completes verification (Step 8)
2. Receives approval email
3. Opens app â†’ Dashboard shows banner
4. Dismisses banner ("I'll do it later")
5. Goes to Bookings â†’ Sees bookings but cannot accept
6. Tap Accept â†’ Alert appears
7. **Expected:** Tap "Setup Payments" â†’ 80% conversion

### Day 2: Exploring Dashboard

2. Goes to Earnings â†’ Empty state UI
3. Reads benefits list
4. **Expected:** Tap "Setup Payments Now" â†’ 50% conversion

### Day 3: New Booking Inquiry

### Day 8: Banner Respawn
1. Opens app â†’ Banner reappears (7 days passed)
2. **Expected:** Tap banner â†’ 30% conversion

---

## Test Scenario 7: State Transitions

### Test All Access States
1. **Not verified + No payment** â†’ Blocked by verification gate
2. **Pending verification + No payment** â†’ Blocked by verification gate
3. **In review + No payment** â†’ Blocked by verification gate
4. **Approved + No payment** â†’ Banner visible, gates active
5. **Approved + Payment active** â†’ Banner hidden, gates inactive

### Database State Changes
```sql
-- Test approved + no payment
UPDATE profiles SET verification_status = 'approved', stripe_charges_enabled = false WHERE id = 'provider-id';

-- Test approved + payment active
UPDATE profiles SET verification_status = 'approved', stripe_charges_enabled = true WHERE id = 'provider-id';

-- Test pending + no payment
UPDATE profiles SET verification_status = 'pending', stripe_charges_enabled = false WHERE id = 'provider-id';
```

### Expected Query Behavior
- useProviderAccess should refetch on window focus
- Status changes should reflect within 30 seconds (cache time)
- Mutations should invalidate provider-access query key

---

## Performance Testing

### Load Times
- useProviderAccess query â†’ <100ms (cached after first load)
- Banner render â†’ <50ms (conditional render is fast)
- Payment setup screen â†’ <200ms (includes Stripe API call)
- Gate checks â†’ <10ms (computed flags from cached data)

### Memory Usage
- PaymentSetupBanner â†’ Minimal (unmounts when hidden)
- useProviderAccess â†’ Single instance per provider (React Query cache)
- AsyncStorage â†’ One key (payment-banner-dismissed)

### Battery Impact
- Refetch on window focus â†’ Acceptable (30-second staleTime prevents excessive polling)
- No background polling (React Query only refetches on active usage)

---

## Regression Testing

### Verify No Breaking Changes
1. **Customer flow** â†’ Should work normally (no impact)
2. **Verification flow** â†’ Should complete at Step 8 (not Step 9)
3. **Provider with payment active** â†’ Should NOT see any gates
4. **Provider bookings** â†’ Accept/decline should work normally (when payment active)
5. **Provider earnings** â†’ Should show full dashboard (when payment active)

### TypeScript Compilation
```bash
# Should have ZERO errors
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### E2E Flow Test
1. New provider signs up
2. Completes 8-step verification
3. Waits for approval
4. Receives approval â†’ Dashboard accessible
5. Sees payment banner â†’ Dismisses
6. Tries to accept booking â†’ Alert appears
7. Taps "Setup Payments" â†’ Completes Stripe OAuth
8. Returns to app â†’ Banner hidden
9. Accept booking â†’ Works normally âœ…

---

## Debugging Commands

### Check Provider Access State
```typescript
// In React DevTools or console
const access = useProviderAccess();
console.log('Access:', access);
// Should show: canAcceptBookings, canViewEarnings, needsPaymentSetup, etc.
```

### Check Banner Dismissal State
```javascript
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
const dismissed = await AsyncStorage.getItem('payment-banner-dismissed');
console.log('Banner dismissed:', dismissed);
```

### Check Supabase Profile Data
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  verification_status,
  stripe_account_status,
  stripe_charges_enabled,
  stripe_details_submitted,
  stripe_account_id
FROM profiles
WHERE id = 'provider-id';
```

### Check React Query Cache
```typescript
import { useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';
const queryClient = useQueryClient();
const cacheData = queryClient.getQueryData(['provider-access', userId]);
console.log('Cache:', cacheData);
```
