## 🔄 Complete Payment Flow

### Step 1: Booking Form (`book-service.tsx`)
```
Customer selects:
- Date & Time
- Service Location
- Special Requests
↓
Navigate to payment screen
```

### Step 2: Payment Processing (`payment.tsx`)
```
1. Calculate amounts:
   - Service Price: £90
   - Platform Fee: £9 (10%)
   - Total Customer Pays: £99

2. Create Stripe Payment Intent:
   - Amount: £99
   - Capture Method: Manual
   
3. Customer confirms payment (Stripe SDK)

4. Capture full amount via edge function:
   POST /capture-deposit
   {
     totalAmount: 9900,      // £99 in pence
     providerAmount: 9000,   // £90 in pence
     platformFee: 900        // £9 in pence
   }

5. Database updated:
   payment_status: 'funds_held_in_escrow'
   captured_amount: 99.00
   amount_held_for_provider: 90.00
   platform_fee_held: 9.00

6. Navigate to confirmation
```

### Step 3: Booking Confirmation (`confirmation.tsx`)
```
Shows customer:
✅ "Amount Paid: £99.00"
✅ "Full amount charged and held securely in escrow"
✅ "Provider receives payment automatically when service is marked complete"

Customer understands:
- Single charge of £99
- No remaining balance
- Payment protected in escrow
- Provider paid automatically at completion
```

### Step 4: Booking Details (`[id].tsx`)
```
Customer can view:
- Base Amount: £90
- Platform Fee: £9
- Total: £99
- Status: Confirmed/In Progress/Completed
- Actions: Contact, Reschedule, Cancel
```

### Step 5: Service Completion (Backend)
```
Provider marks service complete:

POST /complete-booking
{
  bookingId: "abc123"
}

Edge function:
1. Validates booking status
2. Checks provider Stripe account
3. Creates Stripe Connect transfer:
   - Amount: £90
   - Destination: provider.stripe_account_id
4. Platform automatically keeps £9 commission
5. Updates database:
   payment_status: 'payout_completed'
   provider_paid_at: timestamp
   provider_transfer_id: 'tr_xyz'
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Before Escrow System ❌
**Confusing Customer Journey**:
1. "Deposit: £18" → Customer thinks: "Why only £18?"
2. "Remaining: £81" → Customer thinks: "When do I pay this?"
3. Bank statement: £18 charge → Customer: "Where's the rest?"
4. Service day: £81 charge → Customer: "Why am I charged again?!"

**Result**: Confused customers, support tickets, refund requests

### After Escrow System ✅
**Clear Customer Journey**:
1. "Amount Paid: £99" → Customer: "Clear, I paid £99 total"
2. "Held in escrow" → Customer: "My payment is protected"
3. Bank statement: £99 charge → Customer: "Exactly what I expected"
4. Service completes → Customer: "Great service, already paid"

**Result**: Happy customers, no confusion, professional experience
