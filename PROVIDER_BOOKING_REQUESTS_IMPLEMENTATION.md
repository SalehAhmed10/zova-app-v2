# Provider Booking Acceptance Flow - Implementation Complete

**Status**: ✅ Ready for Testing  
**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Implementation Time**: ~2 hours

---

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. React Query Hooks (3 files)

#### ✅ `usePendingBookings.ts`
- Fetches all pending bookings for authenticated provider
- Auto-refetches every 60 seconds for accurate countdown timers
- Properly transforms Supabase response to match TypeScript interface
- Uses `useAuthPure()` following ZOVA architecture

#### ✅ `useAcceptBooking.ts`
- Mutation hook to accept pending bookings
- Calls `accept-booking` Edge Function with JWT auth
- Invalidates all booking queries on success
- Shows success/error alerts
- Handles authentication errors gracefully

#### ✅ `useDeclineBooking.ts`
- Mutation hook to decline pending bookings
- Calls `decline-booking` Edge Function (automatically creates Stripe refund)
- Accepts optional decline reason
- Invalidates all booking queries on success
- Shows user-friendly success message about refund

---

### 2. UI Components (4 files)

#### ✅ `CountdownTimer.tsx`
- Displays "Respond X hours ago" countdown
- Updates every minute
- Shows in **red** when less than 1 hour remaining
- Uses `date-fns` for human-readable formatting

#### ✅ `DeclineReasonModal.tsx`
- Bottom sheet modal for decline reason
- 5 preset reasons (Schedule conflict, Not available, etc.)
- Custom reason input when "Other" selected
- 500 character limit with counter
- Can't submit without selecting a reason

#### ✅ `BookingRequestCard.tsx`
- Displays booking details (customer, service, price)
- Accept button (green, prominent)
- Decline button (red, secondary)
- Countdown timer in header
- Loading states during API calls
- Opens DeclineReasonModal on decline
- Shows processing indicator

#### ✅ `booking-requests.tsx` (Main Screen)
- Full-screen booking requests list
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Loading state with spinner
- Empty state with helpful message
- Header shows count: "Booking Requests (3)"
- Information banner at top explaining 24-hour rule
- FlatList with proper performance optimization

---

### 3. Export Management (2 files)

#### ✅ `src/hooks/provider/index.ts`
Updated to export:
- `usePendingBookings`
- `useAcceptBooking`
- `useDeclineBooking`

#### ✅ `src/components/provider/index.ts`
Created with exports:
- `BookingRequestCard`
- `CountdownTimer`
- `DeclineReasonModal`

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### ✅ Architecture Compliance
- **React Query** for all server state (pending bookings)
- **Zustand** avoided in favor of React Query for this feature
- **useAuthPure()** for authentication (follows ZOVA patterns)
- **Zero useEffect patterns** - pure React Query mutations
- **Proper TypeScript** interfaces for type safety

### ✅ User Experience
- Real-time countdown timers (updates every minute)
- Pull-to-refresh for instant updates
- Optimistic UI updates (queries invalidated on success)
- Clear loading states
- User-friendly error messages
- Decline with optional reason (stored in database)
- Information banner explaining 24-hour policy

### ✅ Performance
- Auto-refetch interval: 60 seconds (not excessive)
- Refetch on window focus (keeps data fresh)
- 30-second stale time (balances freshness with performance)
- Proper FlatList with `keyExtractor`
- Query caching with React Query

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Setup Test Environment

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd c:\Dev-work\mobile-apps\ZOVA

# Install dependencies (if not already)
npm install date-fns

# Start the development server
npm start
```

### 2. Create Test Booking

Since provider `artinsane00@gmail.com` has `auto_confirm_bookings = false`, any new booking will be pending:

**Option A**: Create booking via mobile app as customer
1. Log in as customer account
2. Search for provider artinsane00@gmail.com
3. Select a service and create booking
4. Complete payment
5. Booking will be created with `status='pending'`

**Option B**: Create test booking via SQL (faster for testing)
```sql
-- Find provider and customer IDs
SELECT id, email FROM profiles WHERE email IN ('artinsane00@gmail.com', 'customer@test.com');

-- Insert test booking
INSERT INTO bookings (
  provider_id, 
  customer_id, 
  service_id, 
  status, 
  auto_confirmed,
  base_amount,
  total_amount,
  payment_status,
  provider_response_deadline
) VALUES (
  'PROVIDER_ID_HERE',
  'CUSTOMER_ID_HERE',
  'SERVICE_ID_HERE',
  'pending',
  false,
  100.00,
  115.00,
  'paid',
  NOW() + INTERVAL '24 hours'
);
```

### 3. Navigate to Booking Requests Screen

**Option A**: Add to provider navigation (recommended)
Update `src/app/provider/_layout.tsx` to add a new tab:
```typescript
<Tabs.Screen
  name="booking-requests"
  options={{
    title: 'Requests',
    tabBarIcon: ({ color }) => <TabBarIcon name="clock" color={color} />,
  }}
/>
```

**Option B**: Navigate programmatically
```typescript
import { router } from 'expo-router';
router.push('/provider/booking-requests');
```

### 4. Test Accept Flow
1. Open booking requests screen
2. See pending booking card
3. Verify countdown timer shows correct time
4. Tap "Accept" button
5. Verify loading state
6. Verify success alert
7. Verify booking disappears from list

### 5. Test Decline Flow
1. Create another test booking
2. Tap "Decline" button
3. Verify DeclineReasonModal opens
4. Select a preset reason or enter custom
5. Tap "Confirm Decline"
6. Verify loading state
7. Verify success alert (mentions refund)
8. Verify booking disappears from list
9. **Check Stripe Dashboard** for refund

## 📊 Expected API Calls

### Accept Booking
```http
POST https://YOUR_SUPABASE_URL/functions/v1/accept-booking
Authorization: Bearer {JWT_TOKEN}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "booking_id": "uuid-here"
}

Response (200):
{
  "success": true,
  "booking": { /* updated booking */ },
  "message": "Booking accepted successfully"
}
```

### Decline Booking
```http
POST https://YOUR_SUPABASE_URL/functions/v1/decline-booking
Authorization: Bearer {JWT_TOKEN}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "booking_id": "uuid-here",
  "reason": "Schedule conflict"
}

Response (200):
{
  "success": true,
  "booking": { /* updated booking */ },
  "refund_id": "re_xxxxx",
  "message": "Booking declined and refunded successfully"
}
```

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### 1. Push Notifications Not Implemented
**Impact**: Customer doesn't get notified when booking is accepted/declined

**Solution**: Implement push notifications (see NEXT_STEPS_PRIORITY_ROADMAP.md Week 2)

**Workaround**: Customer can check booking status in their bookings list

---

### 2. No Badge Count in Navigation
**Impact**: Provider doesn't know there are pending requests without opening screen

**Solution**: Add badge count to tab bar icon showing pending bookings count

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// In provider/_layout.tsx
const { data: pendingBookings } = usePendingBookings();
const pendingCount = pendingBookings?.length || 0;

<Tabs.Screen
  name="booking-requests"
  options={{
    title: 'Requests',
    tabBarBadge: pendingCount > 0 ? pendingCount : undefined,
  }}
/>
```

---

### 3. Timeout Expiration Not Automated
**Impact**: Bookings that expire (24 hours pass) stay as "pending" forever

**Solution**: Create `check-booking-timeouts` cron function (see roadmap)

**Workaround**: None - must create cron function for production

## 📞 Support

If issues arise:
- Check Edge Function logs: `mcp_supabase_get_logs` with service='edge-function'
- Check Stripe Dashboard for refund status
- Verify provider has `auto_confirm_bookings = false` in database
- Ensure booking has `provider_response_deadline` set (trigger should do this)
