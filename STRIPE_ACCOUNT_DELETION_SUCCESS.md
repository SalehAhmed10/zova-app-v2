## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Chrome Opens (External Browser):
```
❌ Problem: External browser instead of in-app
✅ Solution: 
  1. Make sure app restarted with new code
  2. Check payments.tsx uses WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync
  3. Not Linking.openURL
```

### If Phone Field Empty:
```
❌ Problem: Phone not pre-filled
✅ Check:
  1. Database has phone: +44310226959 ✅ (verified)
  2. Edge function v104 deployed ✅
  3. Account created (not updated) ✅
  4. Opens in IN-APP browser (not Chrome)
```

### If "Use Test Phone" Errors:
```
❌ Problem: "Something went wrong" error
✅ Solution:
  1. Verify IN-APP browser (not Chrome)
  2. Check session/JWT in browser
  3. Confirm test mode enabled
  4. Try manual entry as fallback
```

## 📊 What Changed

### Code Changes:
1. ✅ **setup-payment/index.tsx** - Uses WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync
2. ✅ **payments.tsx** - UPDATED to use WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync

### Database Changes:
```sql
-- Old state (deleted):
stripe_account_id: acct_1SHpKtCXEzM5o0X3 (without phone)

-- Current state (ready for new account):
stripe_account_id: NULL (will be created with phone)
```

### Expected New Account:
```
Old: acct_1SHpKtCXEzM5o0X3 (no phone, incomplete)
New: acct_XXXXXXXXXX (with phone, complete) ✅
```

## 🎓 Key Points

### Why This Works Now:

1. **Phone at Creation** ✅
   - Old account: created without phone
   - New account: will create WITH phone
   - Stripe only accepts phone at creation time

2. **In-App Browser** ✅
   - Old: External Chrome (context lost)
   - New: In-app browser (context maintained)
   - All Stripe features enabled

3. **Clean Slate** ✅
   - Old account deleted
   - Database cleared
   - Ready for fresh start

### The Complete Fix:

```
Problem:
  ❌ Account created without phone
  ❌ Stripe won't update phone after creation
  ❌ Chrome browser loses context

Solution:
  ✅ Delete old account
  ✅ Create new account WITH phone
  ✅ Use in-app browser for context
  ✅ All features work
```

## 🚀 Ready to Test!
