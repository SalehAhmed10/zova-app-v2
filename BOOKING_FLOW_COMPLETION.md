### Database Schema

**Core Tables**:
- `bookings`: Main booking records
- `provider_services`: Available services
- `provider_schedules`: Provider availability
- `payment_intents`: Stripe PaymentIntent tracking
- `payments`: Payment charge tracking

**Relationships**:
```sql
bookings
├── customer_id → auth.users (customer)
├── provider_id → auth.users (provider)
└── service_id → provider_services

payment_intents
└── booking_id → bookings

payments
└── booking_id → bookings
```

### Edge Functions

**create-payment-intent** (Version: Latest):
- Creates Stripe PaymentIntent
- Calculates deposit amount (20%)
- Returns client secret for Payment Sheet

**create-booking** (Version: 31):
- Verifies payment succeeded
- Validates provider availability
- Calculates platform fee (15%)
- Creates booking record
- Creates payment tracking records
- Returns booking confirmation

## 🎯 Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Payment Architecture
**Decision**: Use Stripe PaymentIntents with Payment Sheet  
**Rationale**: 
- Native mobile UI for best UX
- Supports multiple payment methods
- Handles 3D Secure automatically
- Reduces PCI compliance scope

**Alternative Considered**: Direct card tokenization  
**Why Not**: More complex, less secure, limited payment methods

### 2. Deposit System
**Decision**: Charge 20% deposit upfront, rest on service day  
**Rationale**:
- Reduces no-show risk
- Provides commitment from customer
- Improves cash flow for platform
- Industry standard practice

**Formula**: `depositAmount = servicePrice * 0.20`

### 3. Platform Fee
**Decision**: Charge 15% platform fee on base amount  
**Rationale**:
- Sustainable business model
- Competitive with similar platforms
- Transparent to customers
- Fair to providers

**Formula**: `platformFee = baseAmount * 0.15`

### 4. Payment Tracking
**Decision**: Store both PaymentIntent and Charge records  
**Rationale**:
- Complete audit trail
- Fast queries without Stripe API
- Support future refund system
- Analytics and reporting

**Implementation**: Non-blocking inserts after booking creation

### 5. JWT Verification
**Decision**: Disable legacy JWT verification, parse manually  
**Rationale**:
- Legacy system incompatible with current auth
- Manual parsing gives more control
- Better error handling
- Recommended by Supabase for Edge Functions

### 6. Error Handling Strategy
**Decision**: Non-blocking errors for non-critical operations  
**Rationale**:
- Payment tracking shouldn't block booking
- Log errors for monitoring
- Graceful degradation
- Better user experience

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Payment Security
- ✅ Payment verification before booking creation
- ✅ Stripe webhook signature verification (planned)
- ✅ Amount validation server-side
- ✅ Idempotency keys for payment operations
- ✅ Secure storage of Stripe IDs only (no sensitive data)

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ JWT token authentication
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ Service role for system operations
- ✅ User ID validation in Edge Functions
- ✅ No client-side bypassing of security

### Data Integrity
- ✅ Database constraints and foreign keys
- ✅ Transaction rollback on errors
- ✅ Provider availability locking
- ✅ Duplicate booking prevention
- ✅ Comprehensive audit logging

---

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

### Database
- Indexed columns for common queries
- Efficient RLS policies
- Optimized joins for booking queries
- Connection pooling via Supabase

### React Query
- Aggressive caching for availability data
- Prefetching for anticipated navigation
- Optimistic updates for instant feedback
- Background refetching for data freshness

### Edge Functions
- Minimal dependencies for faster cold starts
- Efficient Stripe API usage
- Parallel database operations where possible
- Proper error boundaries

### Mobile App
- React Native Reanimated for smooth animations
- FlashList for performant scrolling
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Minimal bundle size

## 🐛 Issues Encountered & Resolved

### Issue #1: JWT Verification Error
**Problem**: Edge Function failing with FunctionsHttpError after payment  
**Root Cause**: "Verify JWT with legacy secret" enabled in dashboard  
**Solution**: Disabled setting, redeployed with --no-verify-jwt  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  
**Documentation**: `.github/guides/EDGE_FUNCTION_JWT_ERROR_RESOLUTION.md`

### Issue #2: Missing Payment Tracking
**Problem**: payment_intents and payments tables empty  
**Root Cause**: Records not created in initial Edge Function  
**Solution**: Added automatic record creation, backfilled existing  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  
**Impact**: Complete financial audit trail now available

### Issue #3: Button Hanging
**Problem**: Button stuck on "Processing..." indefinitely  
**Root Cause**: Edge Function not deploying with dependencies  
**Solution**: Full redeployment with CLI including _shared/cors.ts  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  
**Prevention**: Always deploy with full dependencies

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### Configuration Management
1. **Dashboard settings override CLI flags**: Always verify in UI
2. **Test after deployment**: Don't assume configuration persists
3. **Document configuration**: Include in deployment checklist

### Error Handling
1. **Non-blocking for non-critical**: Payment tracking shouldn't block booking
2. **Comprehensive logging**: Log everything for debugging
3. **User-friendly messages**: Don't expose technical errors to users

### Testing Strategy
1. **Test with production auth**: Catch JWT issues early
2. **End-to-end testing**: Full flow including payment
3. **Database verification**: Always check records created

### Development Workflow
1. **Deploy with dependencies**: Full bundle deployment needed
2. **Version tracking**: Monitor Edge Function versions
3. **Incremental enhancement**: Get core working, then add features

- Total: £115.00

**Provider Receives**:
- From deposit: £20.00
- From final payment: £80.00
- Total: £100.00 (original price)

**Platform Receives**:
- Platform fee (15% of £100): £15.00

**Verification**:
- Customer pays: £20 + £95 = £115 ✅
- Provider gets: £100 ✅
- Platform gets: £15 ✅
- Total: £115 = £100 + £15 ✅
