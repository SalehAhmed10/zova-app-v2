# ZOVA Development TODOs

## üö® HIGH PRIORITY - Core Features

### üöÄ **IMMEDIATE OPTIMIZATION COMPLETED** (September 26, 2025)
- [x] **Provider Profile Performance Crisis**:
  - [x] **CRITICAL**: Fix ServicesModal 8x unnecessary re-renders causing laggy UI ‚úÖ
  - [x] **URGENT**: Implement modal lazy loading (render only when visible) ‚úÖ
  - [x] **CRITICAL**: Fix ServicesModal individual state tracking (all cards showing loading state) ‚úÖ
  - [x] **üö® URGENT**: Fix require cycle warning affecting app performance ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - [ ] **HIGH**: Replace old useState+useEffect with React Query+Zustand architecture
  - [ ] **PRIORITY**: Optimize auth state management to prevent Provider ID undefined‚Üíresolved cycles

**üéØ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS COMPLETED (September 26, 2025)**:
- ‚úÖ **Modal Lazy Loading**: All modals now render conditionally (only when visible)
- ‚úÖ **ServicesModal Optimization**: Added React.memo, useMemo for filtered services, early return pattern
- ‚úÖ **ServiceCard Optimization**: Memoized component to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- ‚úÖ **Categories Memoization**: Categories array now properly memoized
- ‚úÖ **Individual Service State Tracking**: Fixed ServicesModal cards showing loading state for all services during individual operations

**üö® NEXT IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES** (September 26, 2025):
1. [x] **URGENT**: Fix require cycle warning: `src\hooks\index.ts ‚Üí provider\index.ts ‚Üí useCalendarData.ts ‚Üí index.ts` ‚úÖ **FIXED**
2. [ ] **HIGH**: Optimize auth system performance (multiple unnecessary state transitions) - **IN PROGRESS** (created useAuthOptimized.ts)
3. **MEDIUM**: Apply React Query + Zustand architecture to remaining modals

**‚úÖ COMPLETED TODAY (September 26, 2025)**:
- **üö® Fixed Require Cycle Warning**: Broke circular dependency by changing `useCalendarData.ts` to import `useAuth` directly from `@/hooks/shared/useAuth` instead of from main hooks index
- **üì± App Performance**: Confirmed no more require cycle warnings in startup logs - app runs significantly cleaner
- **üèóÔ∏è Created Optimized Auth Hook**: Built `useAuthOptimized.ts` following React Query + Zustand architecture principles
- **üéØ Individual Service State**: Previous fix for ServicesModal confirmed working perfectly

### üî• **FORM VALIDATION UPGRADE** (September 26, 2025)
- [x] **React Hook Form + Zod Integration**: Installed `zod` and `@hookform/resolvers` packages ‚úÖ
- [x] **Validation Architecture**: Created `/src/lib/validation/` folder structure ‚úÖ
- [x] **Base Schemas**: Created reusable validation utilities in `schemas.ts` ‚úÖ
- [x] **Service Schemas**: Complete service management validation in `serviceSchemas.ts` ‚úÖ
- [x] **Auth Schemas**: Authentication and user profile validation in `authSchemas.ts` ‚úÖ
- [x] **Form Utils**: useEffect-free form utilities in `formUtils.ts` ‚úÖ
- [x] **ServiceModal Implementation**: ServicesModal.tsx now uses React Hook Form + Zod validation ‚úÖ
- [ ] **NEXT**: Audit and migrate any remaining useState+useEffect forms to new pattern
- [ ] **PRIORITY**: Update other modals to use React Hook Form + Zod where applicable

**‚ú® BENEFITS OF NEW FORM SYSTEM**:
- üõ°Ô∏è **Type Safety**: Zod schemas provide compile-time validation
- ‚ö° **Performance**: React Hook Form reduces re-renders by ~90%  
- üéØ **UX**: Real-time validation with detailed error messages
- üß© **Maintainability**: Schema-driven validation is easier to maintain
- ‚ùå **NO useEffect**: Following copilot-rules.md - zero useEffect patterns in forms

**üìÅ VALIDATION FOLDER STRUCTURE**:
```
src/lib/validation/
