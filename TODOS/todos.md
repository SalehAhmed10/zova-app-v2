## 🚨 HIGH PRIORITY - Core Features

### 🚀 **IMMEDIATE OPTIMIZATION COMPLETED** (September 26, 2025)
- [x] **Provider Profile Performance Crisis**:
  - [x] **CRITICAL**: Fix ServicesModal 8x unnecessary re-renders causing laggy UI ✅
  - [x] **URGENT**: Implement modal lazy loading (render only when visible) ✅
  - [x] **CRITICAL**: Fix ServicesModal individual state tracking (all cards showing loading state) ✅
  - [x] **🚨 URGENT**: Fix require cycle warning affecting app performance ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - [ ] **HIGH**: Replace old useState+useEffect with React Query+Zustand architecture
  - [ ] **PRIORITY**: Optimize auth state management to prevent Provider ID undefined→resolved cycles

**🎯 PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS COMPLETED (September 26, 2025)**:
- ✅ **Modal Lazy Loading**: All modals now render conditionally (only when visible)
- ✅ **ServicesModal Optimization**: Added React.memo, useMemo for filtered services, early return pattern
- ✅ **ServiceCard Optimization**: Memoized component to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- ✅ **Categories Memoization**: Categories array now properly memoized
- ✅ **Individual Service State Tracking**: Fixed ServicesModal cards showing loading state for all services during individual operations

**🚨 NEXT IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES** (September 26, 2025):
1. [x] **URGENT**: Fix require cycle warning: `src\hooks\index.ts → provider\index.ts → useCalendarData.ts → index.ts` ✅ **FIXED**
2. [ ] **HIGH**: Optimize auth system performance (multiple unnecessary state transitions) - **IN PROGRESS** (created useAuthOptimized.ts)
3. **MEDIUM**: Apply React Query + Zustand architecture to remaining modals

**✅ COMPLETED TODAY (September 26, 2025)**:
- **🚨 Fixed Require Cycle Warning**: Broke circular dependency by changing `useCalendarData.ts` to import `useAuth` directly from `@/hooks/shared/useAuth` instead of from main hooks index
- **📱 App Performance**: Confirmed no more require cycle warnings in startup logs - app runs significantly cleaner
- **🏗️ Created Optimized Auth Hook**: Built `useAuthOptimized.ts` following React Query + Zustand architecture principles
- **🎯 Individual Service State**: Previous fix for ServicesModal confirmed working perfectly

### 🔥 **FORM VALIDATION UPGRADE** (September 26, 2025)
- [x] **React Hook Form + Zod Integration**: Installed `zod` and `@hookform/resolvers` packages ✅
- [x] **Validation Architecture**: Created `/src/lib/validation/` folder structure ✅
- [x] **Base Schemas**: Created reusable validation utilities in `schemas.ts` ✅
- [x] **Service Schemas**: Complete service management validation in `serviceSchemas.ts` ✅
- [x] **Auth Schemas**: Authentication and user profile validation in `authSchemas.ts` ✅
- [x] **Form Utils**: useEffect-free form utilities in `formUtils.ts` ✅
- [x] **ServiceModal Implementation**: ServicesModal.tsx now uses React Hook Form + Zod validation ✅
- [ ] **NEXT**: Audit and migrate any remaining useState+useEffect forms to new pattern
- [ ] **PRIORITY**: Update other modals to use React Hook Form + Zod where applicable

**✨ BENEFITS OF NEW FORM SYSTEM**:
- 🛡️ **Type Safety**: Zod schemas provide compile-time validation
- ⚡ **Performance**: React Hook Form reduces re-renders by ~90%  
- 🎯 **UX**: Real-time validation with detailed error messages
- 🧩 **Maintainability**: Schema-driven validation is easier to maintain
- ❌ **NO useEffect**: Following copilot-rules.md - zero useEffect patterns in forms

**📁 VALIDATION FOLDER STRUCTURE**:
```
src/lib/validation/
├── index.ts              # Central exports
