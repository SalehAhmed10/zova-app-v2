# 🔍 STRIPE ACCOUNT COMPARISON - URGENT CLARIFICATION

## 📧 YOU HAVE 2 DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS

### **Account 1: "Zovah" (PRODUCTION ACCOUNT)** 🏢
**Email Invitation**: From `gyles@brussellakeparagon.com`  
**Dashboard**: https://dashboard.stripe.com/acct_1S7ef2IO9K9pFTMD/dashboard  
**Account ID**: `acct_1S7ef2IO9K9pFTMD`  
**Role**: Administrator  
**API Keys**:
- Publishable: `pk_live_51S7ef2IO9K9pFTMD4RSvGzlfWkiP4msKNigzjhq91tG7DIwhZxlu02MFHE4fXdJRaSRhZgeWWbbo4bUquXG5jHrs00v0RVwbFA`
- Secret: (Hidden - need to reveal)

**Status**: 
- ✅ This is the LIVE/PRODUCTION account
- ✅ Real business account "Zovah"
- ✅ Has real payment data (£0.00 but ready for real transactions)
- ❌ **NOT CONFIGURED YET** - We haven't set this one up!

---

### **Account 2: "Zovah Sandbox" (WHAT WE'VE BEEN USING)** 🧪
**Dashboard**: https://dashboard.stripe.com/acct_1S7efRILA2CYnzre/test/dashboard  
**Account ID**: `acct_1S7efRILA2CYnzre`  
**Type**: Test Mode / Sandbox  
**API Keys** (Currently in your .env):
- Publishable: `pk_test_51S7efRILA2CYnzreI537TTJFN99fJngCOiEdFF8dc1S1V6gBoDnwERl0BOYpOG0G8IIU415kIVyIB3Pbiuw1nphR00GLWBdqqH`

**Status**:
- ✅ Fully configured (API keys, webhook, products, prices)
- ✅ Test mode only
- ❌ This is NOT the main production account!
- ⚠️ **WRONG ACCOUNT** - This appears to be a separate test/sandbox account

---

## 🤔 WHAT "SANDBOX" MEANS IN YOUR CASE

Looking at the image you mentioned (`zova-stripe.png`), you see **"Zovah Sandbox"** in the top corner.

This means:
- The client created a **separate Stripe account** just for testing
- This is NOT the same as "Test Mode" on the production account
- This is a completely different account from the main "Zovah" account

---

## ⚠️ THE PROBLEM

You've been configuring the **WRONG account**!

### What You Need to Do:

#### **Option A: Use Production Account in Test Mode** (RECOMMENDED) ✅
Use Account 1 (`acct_1S7ef2IO9K9pFTMD`) in TEST MODE:
- Get the **TEST API keys** from the main "Zovah" account
- Switch the dashboard toggle to "Test Mode"
- Copy test keys (will start with `pk_test_` and `sk_test_`)
- Replace your current `.env` keys
- Recreate products, webhooks in the MAIN account's test mode

**Why?** 
- Everything you configure in Test Mode carries over to Live Mode
- Easy to switch when ready for production
- One account to manage

#### **Option B: Continue with Sandbox Account** (NOT RECOMMENDED) ❌
- Keep using `acct_1S7efRILA2CYnzre`
- You'll have to recreate EVERYTHING in the production account later
- More work, more confusion

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN

### **Step 1: Verify Which Account to Use**
Contact your client (gyles@brussellakeparagon.com) and ask:

> "Should I use the main 'Zovah' account (acct_1S7ef2IO9K9pFTMD) in Test Mode, or continue with the 'Zovah Sandbox' account (acct_1S7efRILA2CYnzre)?"

### **Step 2: If Main Account - Get Test Keys**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/acct_1S7ef2IO9K9pFTMD/dashboard
2. Toggle to **"Test Mode"** (top right corner switch)
3. Go to: Developers → API Keys
4. Copy **Test** API keys (not Live keys!)
5. Update your `.env` file

### **Step 3: Migrate Configuration**
If switching to main account:
- ✅ Create products again (or I can help)
- ✅ Create webhook again
- ✅ Update `.env` with new keys
- ✅ Update Supabase secrets
- ✅ Redeploy edge functions

## 🚨 URGENT QUESTION FOR YOUR CLIENT

**"Hey [Client], I have access to two Stripe accounts:**

1. **Main 'Zovah' account** (acct_1S7ef2IO9K9pFTMD) - The one you invited me to
2. **'Zovah Sandbox' account** (acct_1S7efRILA2CYnzre) - A separate test account

**Which one should I use for development?**

**My recommendation**: Use the main 'Zovah' account in **Test Mode** so everything I configure will carry over to production when we launch.

Currently, I've been setting everything up in the Sandbox account. Should I migrate everything to the main account instead?"

---

## 💡 MY RECOMMENDATION

### **Switch to Main Account Test Mode** ✅

**Why?**
1. ✅ One account to manage (Test + Live in same place)
2. ✅ Products/webhooks configured once
3. ✅ Easy switch to Live Mode when ready
4. ✅ No migration needed later
5. ✅ You have Administrator access
6. ✅ This is the standard Stripe workflow

**Migration Time**: ~30 minutes
- I can automate most of it if you decide to switch

---

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

1. **Contact client** - Confirm which account to use
2. **If main account**: Get Test Mode API keys
3. **I'll help migrate** - Products, webhooks, everything
4. **Test again** - Verify everything works
5. **Ready for production** - Easy switch to Live keys
