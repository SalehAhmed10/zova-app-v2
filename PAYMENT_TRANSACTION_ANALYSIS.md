## 🔐 Escrow System Analysis

### Current Implementation: **Authorization + Partial Capture**

#### How It Works:
1. **Authorization Phase:**
   - Full amount (£99.00) authorized on customer's card
   - Card issuer holds the funds (not yet charged)
   - Customer sees "pending" transaction

2. **Deposit Capture:**
   - Platform immediately captures 20% deposit (£18.00)
   - Remaining £81.00 authorization is **released back to customer**
   - Customer is charged £18.00 only

3. **Service Completion Payment:**
   - **CRITICAL ISSUE:** After partial capture, remaining authorization is released
   - Platform needs to create NEW payment for remaining balance
   - Customer must authorize final payment again

### ⚠️ **ESCROW ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

**Problem:** Current system does NOT hold full amount in escrow.

**What Happens:**
```
Booking Time:      Customer authorized £99.00
                   ↓
Deposit Capture:   £18.00 captured, £81.00 RELEASED
                   ↓
Service Completion: Need to charge £81.00 again
                   ↓ 
                   Customer must approve NEW payment (not automatic)
```

**Requirements State:**
> "Deposit charged immediately upon booking confirmation"
> "Remaining balance due on service completion"

**This implies:** Platform should hold full payment until service completion, not release it after deposit capture.

## 🚨 Critical Implementation Gap

### Issue: Not a True Escrow System

**Current Flow:**
1. Authorize £99.00 ✅
2. Capture £18.00 deposit ✅
3. Release £81.00 back to customer ❌ **PROBLEM**
4. Service completion: Need new payment authorization ❌ **PROBLEM**

**Expected Escrow Flow:**
1. Authorize £99.00 ✅
2. **HOLD £99.00** until service completion ✅
3. At completion: Capture remaining £81.00 (£72 service + £9 fee) ✅
4. Transfer £90.00 to provider (via Stripe Connect) ✅
5. Platform keeps £9.00 commission ✅

### Why This Matters

**Current System:**
- ❌ Customer can cancel card after deposit
- ❌ Customer must approve second payment
- ❌ Risk of insufficient funds at service completion
- ❌ Poor customer experience (two separate charges)
- ❌ Not a true marketplace escrow

**Proper Escrow System:**
- ✅ Full amount held until service completion
- ✅ Single authorization covers entire transaction
- ✅ Automatic capture at completion
- ✅ True payment protection for providers
- ✅ Matches marketplace requirements

---

## 🔧 Recommended Fix

### Option 1: Full Authorization Hold (RECOMMENDED)

**Change capture-deposit logic:**

**Current Code (capture-deposit/index.ts):**
```typescript
// Captures deposit and releases remaining amount
const captureParams = new URLSearchParams({
  amount_to_capture: depositAmount.toString(), // Only £18
});
```

**Recommended Fix:**
```typescript
// Keep full authorization, only capture deposit
// DO NOT release remaining amount yet
const captureParams = new URLSearchParams({
  amount_to_capture: depositAmount.toString(), // £18 captured
  // capture_method stays 'manual' - keeps remaining authorized
});

// Then call a HOLD endpoint instead of auto-release
// This requires Stripe Connect properly configured
```

**Service Completion Flow:**
```typescript
// When service is marked complete:
const finalCaptureParams = new URLSearchParams({
  amount_to_capture: remainingAmount.toString(), // £81 captured
});

await fetch(`https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents/${paymentIntentId}/capture`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${stripeSecretKey}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
  },
  body: finalCaptureParams,
});
```

### Option 2: Two-Part Payment (Current System)

Keep current flow but:
1. Clearly communicate to customer: "You'll be charged £18 now, £81 at service completion"
2. Add payment method saved to customer profile
3. Auto-charge remaining amount at completion using saved payment method
4. Add proper error handling for failed final charges

```

### Stripe Payment Intent
```json
{
  "id": "pi_3SI4SXIO9K9pFTMD045AMxEm",
  "amount": 9900,                   // £99.00 authorized ✅
  "amount_capturable": 0,           // No remaining amount capturable ❌
  "amount_received": 1800,          // £18.00 captured ✅
  "status": "succeeded",            // Payment succeeded (deposit only)
  "metadata": {
    "total_amount": "9900",         // £99.00
    "deposit_amount": "1800",       // £18.00
    "remaining_amount": "8100"      // £81.00 was released ❌
  }
}
```

**Key Finding:** `amount_capturable: 0` means remaining £81 was released, not held.

---

## 💡 Technical Recommendations

### 1. Keep Authorization Active
**Update capture-deposit/index.ts:**
```typescript
// After capturing deposit, verify authorization is still active
const captureResponse = await fetch(
  `https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents/${paymentIntentId}/capture`,
  {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${stripeSecretKey}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
    },
    body: new URLSearchParams({
      amount_to_capture: depositAmount.toString(),
    }),
  }
);

// Check if remaining amount is still authorized
const updatedPaymentIntent = await captureResponse.json();
console.log('Remaining capturable:', updatedPaymentIntent.amount_capturable);
// Should be 8100 (£81), NOT 0
```

### 2. Service Completion Handler
**Create complete-booking edge function:**
```typescript
// supabase/functions/complete-booking/index.ts
export async function completeBooking(bookingId: string) {
  // 1. Verify service was completed
  // 2. Capture remaining amount from authorization
  // 3. Transfer to provider via Stripe Connect
  // 4. Update booking status to 'completed'
  // 5. Send notifications
}
```

### 3. Stripe Connect Setup
**For provider payouts:**
```typescript
// When creating booking transfer:
const transfer = await stripe.transfers.create({
  amount: 9000, // £90.00 to provider
  currency: 'gbp',
  destination: provider.stripe_account_id,
  description: `Booking ${bookingId} payment`,
  metadata: {
    booking_id: bookingId,
    service_id: serviceId,
  },
});
```

---

## ✅ Conclusion

### What's Working:
- ✅ **10% platform commission** calculated correctly
- ✅ **Customer charged correct amount** (service price + fee)
- ✅ **Provider receives full service price** (£90.00)
- ✅ **Deposit capture** working properly (£18.00)
- ✅ **Transaction tracking** in database accurate
- ✅ **Stripe integration** functional and secure

### What Needs Fixing:
- ❌ **Not a true escrow system** - remaining amount released
- ❌ **Two separate authorizations** required (poor UX)
- ❌ **No automatic completion payment** - manual process needed
- ❌ **Provider payout** not implemented (Stripe Connect needed)
- ❌ **Payment status** misleading ("paid" when only deposit captured)

### Overall Assessment:
**Current Status:** 🟡 **PARTIALLY CORRECT**

The payment calculation and commission structure perfectly match requirements. However, the escrow system is incomplete - it's a two-part payment system rather than a true escrow with full authorization hold. This works but creates:
1. Customer experience issues (two charges)
2. Payment security risks (card could be cancelled)
3. Provider protection gaps (completion payment not guaranteed)

**Recommendation:** Implement proper authorization hold escrow system as outlined in Option 1 above for complete compliance with marketplace requirements.
