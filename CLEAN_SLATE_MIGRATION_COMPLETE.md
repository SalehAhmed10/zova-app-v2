## 🎨 Escrow System Overview

### Payment Flow
```
Customer Books Service (£90)
         ↓
Platform Fee Added (£9)
         ↓
Total Charged: £99
         ↓
Held in Platform Stripe Account (Escrow)
         ↓
Service Completed
         ↓
£90 → Provider (via Stripe Connect Transfer)
£9  → Platform (automatic commission)
```

### Key Benefits
- ✅ **Single charge**: Customer pays £99 once, not £18 + £81
- ✅ **Escrow protection**: Funds held until service completion
- ✅ **Automatic transfers**: Provider gets £90, platform keeps £9
- ✅ **No manual capture**: Full amount captured immediately
- ✅ **Better UX**: Clear "Held in Escrow" messaging

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Payment Fails
1. Check Stripe Dashboard for error details
2. Verify customer has valid payment method
3. Check Edge Function logs: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/wezgwqqdlwybadtvripr/logs/edge-functions

### If Provider Payout Fails
1. Verify provider completed Stripe Express onboarding
2. Check provider's `stripe_account_id` in database
3. Verify provider's `stripe_charges_enabled` = true
4. Check `complete-booking` function logs

### If Wrong Stripe Account Used
- **Old account**: `acct_1S9x3XENAHMeamEY` (BACKUP - commented out in .env)
- **New account**: `acct_1S7ef2IO9K9pFTMD` (ACTIVE - in use)
- All new Connect accounts should start with `acct_1S7ef2...`
